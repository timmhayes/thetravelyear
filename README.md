# TheTravelYear.com

This project was created as a self-contained archive of a 16-month around the world trip. The original website included an admin portal and database for adding and maintaining stories, but since that is no longer required, the site has been rewritten as a simple read-only SPA.

The site uses React, React Router, React Bootstrap, SASS, and interactive mapping via [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/). It also contains static maps generated via script from [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/static-maps) to provide placeholders for missing images.


## Running It Locally

To run the project locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Once you have that, you can run the following commands from the project directory:

### `npm install`

Installs the required dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
