Their comfortable apartment in the heart of Panama City has a wonderful open feel - with walls covered in Gordon's colorful paintings.\n\nThey have been wonderful hosts, taking us on tours of Panama City in a luxurious blue Mercedes. Forget the city bus!\n\nMy impressions of Panama City - vibrant, chaotic, horns constantly beeping, wild drivers, and signs and conversations in a language that I don't understand.\n\nToday we woke up early for a 45 minute ferry to the beautiful island of Toboga, 20 km south of Panama City. The majority of the island is a wildlife refuge. The ferry docks into a small quaint town tucked lazily into a small harbor facing the entrance to the Panama Canal. \n\nWe spent the day sitting by a pool, occasionally getting up to stroll the gardens and gaze out over the ocean. In the late afternoon, Gordon and I took a wonderful stroll through the town. We admired the small colorful houses through winding lanes. The people were simple and unassuming and with everyone we passed was a friendly 'hola!' Amidst flowers and hummingbirds, Gordon and I dreamed about buying a house here and starting our own artist commune. At every point you could look out upon the ocean and see a multitude of ships dotting the horizon waiting to enter the canal.\n\nUnfortunately, Tim was sick most of the day. Pale and weak, he spent most of the day lying in the shade. I was thankful to get him home safe and get him to bed. He felt much better later in the day.\n\nWe leave tomorrow for a week at Gordon and Antonio's beach house 90 minutes outside Panama City to bask in the sun, read, paint, and drink lots of wine."

Mamon fruit provides something fun to nibble on at any time of day. A live-in cook/gardener/maid named Santiago makes the leisure-class lifestyle whole.\n\nWe relax here day after day - reading books, writing, painting, talking, sleeping, eating, tanning, drinking wine, and playing cards. (You notice, cleaning and cooking are not on this list!) We've been here four days and it feels like two. We could stay here a few weeks without a problem. <p>&nbsp;</p> "

(Coffee is an important part of my balanced diet.) As we headed out of the mountains on the old school bus, the sunrise almost woke me up! \n\nBy 8:30 we were headed to San Jose on a larger bus. A couple of hours later we arrived at the Panama / Costa Rica border. Here we walked around aimlessly, never sure of where we were supposed to go and what stamps we needed. Wishing I had studied a little harder in those high school Spanish classes, we made it thought on broken Spanish and sign language. We continued down the Interamerican Highway.\n\nThe Interamerican Highway provides a much needed link through Central American countries. But don't think of it like a US interstate. Although urban parts are indeed highway, you should picture most of the highway as a small country road. This small country road is shared by huge trucks and buses and is without shoulders, dividing lines, or guard rails. \n\nSo we continued down the road and into the Costa Rican mountains. We rose above the cloud line, where the heavy fog and rain made the visibility terrible. Normally, passing a slow moving tractor-trailer on a country road around a blind curve with a cliff on one side makes me a little nervous. But add fog, rain, and front row seats, and you can imagine how I felt. \n\nFortunately, we made it through just fine. Others didn't. The driver of a car we saw crushed by a bus in the mountains was not so lucky.\n\nOn a lighter note, we found a great place to eat dinner in San Jose. We spent way too much on dinner, but sometimes you have to. \n\n\n\n\n"

Boquete is a small town sitting in a mountain valley at the base of an inactive volcano. The mountains surrounding the town rise high and the beautiful citrus and coffee plantations that cover the hills are frequently half obscured in clouds.\n\nWe woke up this morning to a beautiful sunny day! Tim and I started our day with bread and coffee at a local bakery and then headed out to explore. We visited a coffee factory called Cafe Ruiz and were given our own private tour of the facilities - all in Spanish!  Needless to say, I didn't understand much of it but still enjoyed it.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/boquette.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"295\" align=\"right\">We ventured farther down the road and visited \"Mi Jarden es su Jardin\", an amazing gardens surrounding a private estate.  Flowers, running streams, and lawn ornaments were everywhere.  A cross between a classic plantation and a miniature golf course, the garden was truly unique.\n\nWe then walked about 8 miles on back roads above the town among coffee plantations, school children staring at us in awe, and the sparkling Rio Caldera River. The landscape and cool climate reminded me quite a bit of the Colorado mountains. We returned to our pension in the afternoon ready for a nap!\n\n\n"

Running across a soccer field we spotted a shelter by a church and darted towards it.\n\nIt was great to watch the rain come down under the protected covering while we gazed at the volcano in the distance. A local man from the town approached us.  He spoke no English and we hardly spoke any Spanish so the conversation that ensued was quite amusing. Lots of hand gestures and shaking of heads to say \"we don't understand\". I couldn't tell if he wanted to sell us something, wanted money, or if he was just being friendly. He was very persistent though, trying to communicate the same message.  As more time passed his gestures grew more animated and his words louder. He would point at Tim and then myself, make two circles with his hands and then put them together. What could he be telling us?\n\nIn the end, after much struggle, I realized he was asking if Tim and I were a couple. I guess he was interested in my romantic availability. When we told him we were indeed together, he smiled, shook both our hands warmly and continued on. Tim and I just laughed.\n\nI felt I won twice. First, for the flattery of his interest. But more importantly, I at last understood what he was trying to say! Victory comes in small packages."

This being a rainforest in the rainy season, the trails can get pretty muddy - and the trail we chose quickly turned into a long string of muddy holes. \n\nWe quickly found the hike worthy of the mess. The quiet sound of light rain in the forest canopy is very relaxing. And although we didn't see any of the much sought after quetzals, one could stand for hours admiring the forest growth.\n\n<hr>\nWe left the park covered in mud and headed over to the close by <a href='http://www.SkyTrek.com'>SkyTrek</a>. In all honesty, this has been one my favorite experiences so far on the trip!\n\nWhen I was 10 years old, a neighborhood friend installed a zipline between 2 trees in his backyard. By holding a simple pulley device, we flew though the air from tree to tree. Take that basic idea, multiply it by 1000, and you get the adult version called <a href='http://www.SkyTrek.com'>SkyTrek</a>. \n\nThe <a href='http://www.SkyTrek.com'>SkyTrek</a> tour lasts a couple of hours. It starts by strapping you into a harness and walking you into the forest via a suspension bridge. You climb a tree and off you go. \n\nThe first couple of ziplines are short and help you get comfortable with the equipment. As you fly in and above the forest canopy, the ziplines quickly get longer and higher. Tarzan meets George of the Jungle! I had a smile on my face like I was still 10 years old.\n\nAfter about 8 ziplines, we walked to the top of the mountain and came to \"the big one.\" As if leaping from the top of a mountain wasn't high enough, we then climbed to the top of a very tall observation tower. We all held tight to the railings. The wind was so strong that we were literally worrying about flying off! Our very calm and cool guide Gustavo explained that the zipline was about 1400 feet long and 400 feet high. Standing on the platform, I couldn't help but compare that to a 50 story building. \n\nFrom my point of view, the zipline connected the tower I was standing on to the clouds in the distance. When my turn came, Gustavo strapped my harness into the pulley system and told me to have fun. Then he pushed me into the clouds. \n\nWhat a ride!"

The river ran fast, high, and brown as a result of the heavy rain - so we moved along quickly. The tall rainforest trees and vegetation surrounding the river gave the slight impression of rafting through a canyon. As we moved along the river, the guide pointed out egrets, hawks, toucans, iguanas, sloths and monkeys.\n\nWe landed on the muddy bank of the river walls and walked uphill to a farm. We were visiting Don Pedro, a 87 year old farmer who had spent most of his life farming on the edge of this rainforest. As he greeted us we noticed his distinctive weathered face and hands that reflected his hard farm work. With our guide translating, Don Pedro told us of how he came to this area as a young man in his twenties. Now the area is a prosperous farm supporting his extended family.\n\nThe night before his sow had given birth so we were greeted by 17 new piglets! We walked around the farm full of chickens, cows, horses, pigs and dogs. We were welcomed into his house which had dirt for the floor and no walls. While we sipped coffee, he told us stories of the huge snake his family had just killed and the jaguar he saw walking on the edge of his farm.  He said as long as the jaguar left his animals alone, he didn't mind if it roamed nearby.\n\nWe then put on boots that almost reached our knees (to protect us from mud and snakes!) and set off on a small trek in the rainforest. Something red caught Tim's eye at the base of a large tree. It was a colorful poison-arrow frog. It was beautiful with it's bright red body and blue legs. You have to be careful though when touching the frogs. Their skin glands exude toxins and if the toxins get into a cut and your blood stream, it can be deadly.\n\nVenturing a little farther we suddenly realized we were being watched. Directly above us in the trees were howler monkeys.  The male monkeys make a loud howling noise when approached by intruders. To me it sounded like a roar!\n\nBack on the boat, then to a van to drive us back to town. On the road we passed a couple trees with 10 to 15 huge iguanas. Quite cool!\n\n<hr>\nLater in the day we left for a second tour of the Arenal Volcano. Although it was rainy and foggy, the 45 minute hike up to the lava wall was beautiful! Low cloud cover and darkness reduced the landscape to soft shades of gray. The red-eyed frogs throughout the forest surrounded us with a chorus of sound similar to bells. We arrived at the lava wall, sat for a while in the rain, and hiked back down. \n\nThe fog covered our view of the volcano, so we decided to drown our sorrows in the Tabacon Hot Springs. What a place! Water from natural hot springs feeds into 15 or so different pools. Steaming rivers snaked through dark and strangely lit gardens, running over waterfalls and filling pools of different shapes, sizes, and temperatures. There is always something fun about a swim-up bar, even if you can't afford to buy a beer and hang out on the under water bar stool! It was a great way to end the day!\n"

The slow pace and relaxation was well deserved after yesterday's 13-hour return trip from Costa Rica by cab, bus, foot, bus, bus, and cab. Fortunately, sitting in the back of the hot bus made the return trip seem safer - even considering the silent fight I enjoyed with the woman in the next seat over control of  the shared window!\n\nAfter breakfast, we hiked past the small farms in town towards the Parque Internacional La Amistad to look for quetzals.  On the way we met Cookie, a  huge sausage-shaped slobbering rottweiler. As we walked, Cookie followed and marked his territory along the way. We soon discovered his territory covered every piece of property in town. Peeing on house after house, Cookie left behind a trail of barking dogs.\n\nOnce in the park, we walked the lush mountain trails. The cool climate here is the perfect temperature for  hiking.  We explored for a few hours. The dog remained as quiet as we were, but we never spotted a quetzal. \n\nSo now I sit peacefully on a wooden balcony overlooking a street in Guadalupe. It smells like rain. I'm slowly drinking a cup of coffee and watching children play soccer in the street.  A light drizzle starts, but the sun still shines on the terraced mountains around me. A woman in Guayni indian dress holding a plaid umbrella walks briskly through the soccer game, and I stop writing for today.\n"

Our surroundings seemed surreal with loud crashing waves and horses running in the distance on the water's edge.\n\nWalking for a couple hours we were losing hope of spotting a turtle. The only hints of their presence were deep trails left in the sand by turtles who had previously been there but had returned to the sea. When we almost walked the length of the beach we started heading back discouraged. But suddenly one of the guides started whispering excitedly.  Down the beach there was a turtle emerging from the water! We strained our eyes trying desperately to see the dark form.  We had to keep our distance and not use flashlights for fear we would scare the turtle back into the ocean.  Turtles are very careful about laying their eggs.  If they come ashore and feel threatened or that the beach is not safe for the eggs, they will turn around and try a different location farther down the beach.  And that is exactly what this turtle did.  It crawled half way up the beach and then turned around. It was now OK for us to approach it and get a better view. \n\nThe turtle was a green turtle and our guide said in six years of  leading this tour he had never seen this kind of turtle on the beach.  It was an exciting night for all of us.  She was beautiful! We watched as our guides measured her shell (42 inches in length) and made notes. There was definitely a sense of awe in the air as she struggled to pull her large body back into the crashing waves. We stood in silence watching, thankful for the opportunity to see this grand creature.\n"

Like many of Michelle's relatives, Phillip and his family live here in Hawaii. And because a wedding is a great opportunity to get everyone together, Phillip and Christine's wedding became a huge extended reunion.\n\nSo I met Michelle's family - immediate relatives, 10 aunts and uncles, 26 cousins and spouses, and plenty of children.  Over brunch, lunch, dinner, and dessert, I quickly discovered what holds a Hawaiian reunion together...food!\n\nThanks to the generosity of Michelle's family, I spent the week touring Hawaii with my taste buds. So far the scenery has been great: poke (Hawaiian - salad of raw fish), saimen (Japanese - noodle soup), malasadas (Portuguese - doughnuts, similar to ours but without a hole), fish (butterfish, mahi mahi, ahi, salmon, fish cake), haupia (Hawaiian - coconut pudding), mochi (Hawaiian - dessert made from rice flour), dim sum (Chinese - various dumplings), tropical juices, poi (Hawaiian - taro paste), shave ice, custard pie, plate lunch (with 2 scoop rice, 1 scoop macaroni salad), lilikoi (passion fruit) chiffon cake, sushi, papaya, mango, Kona coffee, and more Chinese dishes than I can remember. \n\nWe haven't neglected the tourist side of Oahu. In between meals, we walked through the tall hotels of Waikiki, sat on beautiful crowded beaches, swam with the fish of Hanauma Bay, enjoyed the view from the Pali lookout, and shopped for an aloha shirt. But the highlight of the trip so far is the food. And although Michelle is now poking my increasingly Pillsbury Doughboy-like stomach expecting me to giggle, I would like to thank everyone for a great introduction to the islands!\n\nNext week, we take off on our own to explore the island in a cheap Daewoo compact."

It has been an exciting two weeks of family, food, and beautiful scenery.\n\nTim and I have enjoyed soaking in the Aloha spirit of the islands. We basked on the beaches, snorkeled with turtles, and ate poke (raw fish).\n\nAlthough I haven't lived in Hawaii for 17 years, when I visit I always feel I have returned home. I love the bright sunlight, the tradewinds, and how the fragrance of flowers surrounds me. I love the abundance of fruit, colorful fish when snorkeling, and relaxed attitudes. But most of all I love my extended family for their generosity, sense of humor,  and  kindness. My father was born and raised in Honolulu and I am so thankful that Hawaii is part of my heritage."

The sky is unusual. Pillar-like clouds build the horizon into a puffy cityscape. It is winter here in the South Pacific and the low sun produces long shadows and casts a warm golden color to the landscape.\n\nWe hop a bus and ramble down the coast to our budget guesthouse in the capital of Apia.\n\nPassing through several communities along the way, I'm impressed by how clean everything is. Neatly trimmed hedges, colorful flowers, and painted rocks surround lawns tidy enough to impress any homeowner in middle suburbia. The architecture of countryside homes opens a small window into the Samoan community. Traditionally, families live in thatched roof shelters without walls called fales. Several families' fales surround a large communal fale and make a village. We pass by the newer style fales, some with tin roofs and some with private walled areas. Once in the town of Apia, nearly all the homes we pass are western-style with four walls and regular windows.\n\nWe arrive at the guesthouse, stow our bags, and head out for a walk. Samoa seems about as laid back as any place can get. We walk slowly. Men and women pass by us wearing light sandals and colorful lavalavas (wrap-around skirts). Most of them say hello and smile. In the center of town, we walk through the maketi fou market area. It's a busy place. Samoan vendors sell taro root, bananas, baked goods, koko (cocoa Samoa), crafts, and many vegetables that I can't identify. Over in one corner of the market, a large group of men alternatively laugh and moan over an excited game of dominoes.\n\nWe buy bread and walk home to nap.\n"

The large white house was voted one of the best budget hotels in the South Pacific - but that was a few years ago. The windows of the large open room in front face towards the ocean and let in a nice breeze. The casual furniture laying about invite you to sit down and read. Like every hotel in Apia, the Outrigger is very busy now. The coup in Fiji has scared many travelers out of Fiji and towards Samoa. After all, that is why I am here with Michelle.\n\nToday we took a tour to the south beaches of Upolu. While the weather was beautiful all day in Apia, heavy rain and wind followed us through two different beaches. We moved on to a two-tiered waterfall where, on nice days, one could jump from pool to pool. Today the rough water would have sucked us under faster than a turd in an aircraft toilet. So we moved on to another waterfall. This one was said to have a spectacular view, but the fog prevented us from seeing.\n\nNot to be defeated, we ended the day attending a fiafia at a local hotel. Although this celebration of song, dance, and food has roots in traditional Samoan life, what we attended was definately a product of the tourist trade. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the chance to hear wonderful Samoan voices singing together. Like the young Christians singing through the streets of Apia trying to attract youth to prayer meetings, the performers' harmony just made me happy to listen. \n\nAfter the show, we dined on traditional Samoan food for the first time. I bit into a pile of seaweed. Though it looked like a miniature bunch of sweet grapes, my mouth cringed to the incredibly salty taste. I didn't care for the the sea slug either. I have a hard time describing what it was like, though the thought of it still makes my mouth water in a really unpleasant way. But I was thrilled to try the rest of the food. I had to go back for seconds on taro leaves filled with coconut and breadfruit. All the while we sat next to a head chief's birthday celebration. The performers sat near our table singing happy birthday in Samoan and other Samoan songs. \n\nIt was a great way to end the day.\n \n"

Our cabin by the water at Si'ufaga Beach sports a small kitchen, so I've been experimenting with coconut rice, fresh bananas, Samoan cocoa, and canned food. My eyes are blurry from reading too many books. My only real excitement turned out to be the huge tarantula I found next to the toilet. Needless to say, Michelle wasn't as excited as I was.\n\nBut it is a good day to leave the house and look around the island of Suvai'i. So we rented a car from a guy named Otto. \n\nSuvai'i is one of the largest islands in Polynesia, but circling the island's well paved coastal highway only takes 3 1/2 hours at a slow pace. The style of our Korean-made diesel 4 wheel drive was similar to a classic jeep. Although the car itself was not old, the spongy brakes, broken windshield, fishy steering, and bald tires made me feel like I was driving a true classic. At least it ran well.\n\nWe headed up the east coast of the island looking to complete a counter-clockwise loop. The eastern coast of the 50\t000 person island is the most heavily populated, so we passed through village after village of colorful fales. After the lava fields of the north side, we entered the Falealupo Peninsula. An old Catholic church lay there in ruins, destroyed by a terrible cyclone almost 10 years ago. Continuing down the west coast, we passed tall rocky sea arches and stop in the Taga Blowholes.\n\nThe Taga Blowholes shoot a huge blast of misty air and water every minute or so. It is said to propel coconuts hundreds of feet into the sea. I couldn't help thinking of myself shooting up through it like a human cannonball. I wasn't equipped with a crash helmet and jumpsuit, so I decided not to try it out. Maybe on my next visit.\n\nOur circle complete, we returned the car, hitched a ride from Otto, and made some strange stew with canned mackerel."

      "text": "We walked around the vegetable market on our last full day in Samoa. On a whim, I purchased a carved multi-legged wooden kava bowl. Once I bought that, I decided to buy some kava to match. I picked up something that I found out later was definitely NOT kava and asked the quiet man behind the counter, \"Is this kava?\" In the true Samoan way of pleasing he simply answered, \"Yes.\" \n\nI brought it back to the hotel, held it in the air, and asked the Samoan woman that worked there how to make it. She choked and almost laughed herself to death at what I thought was kava - apparently the straw-like substance is used to make coconut cream and is used as a loofa. I'm quite sure her whole village knew the story about the stupid American by nightfall.\n\nThe drink made from ground kava root, or 'ava as they say here, is used in Samoan kava ceremonies. In a traditional ceremony, men seat themselves in an oval and place the specially made bowl at one end. A ceremonial virgin then filters the ground cumin-looking powder with water until the chief signals that the brew has reached its proper strength. At that time, the chief dips half a coconut shell into the muddy looking water and passes it to each participant. The ceremony can be a brief ritual before a government meeting or an hours-long ritual of a boy meeting his future father-in-law.\n\nKava has several active ingredients and according to the Lonely Planet guide, \"...is both an anaesthetic and analgesic, high in fibre, low in calories, and serves as a mild tranquilizer, an antobacterial and antifungal agent, a painkiller, a diuretic, and appetite suppressant.\" In case you are wondering, it is legal to use in both North America and Europe.\n\nI eventually bought the \"right\" kava in the market and hosted a makeshift kava ceremony at the Outrigger. Unfortunately, the wood stain on my kava bowl ran down the sink when I washed it. The bowl still looked fine, but we decided the neon yellow plastic salad bowl might make a safer alternative. Of course, we filled it with bottled water! After our Samoan friend at the hotel stopped laughing, she helped us prepare the rest. \n\n<img src='/photos/tims_kava.jpg' width=269 height=299 align=left>We poured the kava powder into a cloth and wrapped it into a golf ball sized tea bag. After repeatedly dunking and wringing the kava by hand, the clear water became muddy enough to drink.\n\nWe gathered around the white picnic table in the kitchen and placed the yellow bowl in the center. Using a coffee cup I found in the sink, I solemnly filled five wine glasses full of the brackish brew. We all yelled cheers and drank the bitter root down.\n\nIn a good faith effort to explore and describe the effects of kava, we had a few more glasses. Well, many more. And how did I feel? I had a slightly numb mouth and I felt a little spacey, but the effect was short lived and was no stronger than the effect of drinking a beer.\n\n<div align=center><img src='/photos/drink_kava.jpg' width=300 height=200></div>\n\nThe things I do for TheTravelYear!"

You notice it while taking a walk though Kuirau Park, where pools of boiling mud belch sulphury steam. You notice it in the Polynesian Spa, where you bathe in pools of sulphury \"health-giving\" waters. You even notice it in your hotel's lobby. But you get used to the smell, and eventually you start to find it comforting.\n\nSo I spent the day enjoying the smells of Rotorua. But in the evening, I decided to check out another less touristed smelly attraction - the final round of the New Zealand Darts Championship.\n\nI knew I had arrived to the correct location when I heard the boisterous screaming and smelled the bar-like smokey atmosphere. Yesterday, the sports complex housed a quiet basketball court. Today, the auditorium pulsed with the energy of a bowling alley on league night. Large metal ashtrays filled with cigarette butts lay strewn about. A row of white partitions parallelled the filled grandstand. Each partition sported a carefully lit dartboard, a scribbled on chalkboard, a uniformed scorekeeper, and four burley competitors. \n\nThe audience seemed to know the competitors well. I'm quite sure I was the only spectator who wasn't dating or related to someone throwing darts. A few of the players wore jackets or shirts with their team logo on the back, many of them had tattoos, and most of them possessed a pendulous beer gut. I wouldn't be tempted to call these people athletes, but they were certainly skilled with darts.\n\nI watched several teams play the game \"501\" against each other. The object of this game is to get up to exactly 501 points - fairly simple. For those of you who don't play darts, a dart board is segmented into 20 pie shapes with points associated with each \"piece\". The highest number is 20 which sits on the top of the board. The board also has 2 rings circling the pie, which when hit, double or triple the points of each shot. \n\nPlayers constantly shot for the triple ring of the 20 point. This is rounded area on the board less than an inch long and as wide a pencil. Most of the players were able to hit 2 triple 20's with each turn, and I saw several players hit only triples. You know these competitors are good when the shot to see who goes first becomes a contest to see who can shoot a better bulls-eye!\n\nI watched for a while, until the natural smell of the sulphur springs outside seemed a good trade for the smokey indoors."

In fact, I still consider that day one of my most embarrasing moments of my life. I will spare you the details but will share this one story...\n\nI signed up for the beginners' class. The ski instructor had us line up in a row, skis pointing toward him, going up the mountain. Being very eager to learn, I jumped in line first at the top. As the instructor began to lecture us on the fundamentals of skiing, I lost my balance and proceeded to fall on the person next to me. This made him tip over and he fell on the next person. Soon the domino-like chain reaction that I started had toppled the whole class. Not one person was left standing. The class lay sprawled about, arms and legs flailing trying to get up. The instructor looked at me as the instigator and said spitefully, \"This is going to be a VERY long day, isn't it?\"\n\nI am sorry to say it was a long day and it never got much better. I haven't attempted skiing since. So when Tim suggested we try snowboarding, I flinched with apprehension.\n\nIt had been snowing in the South Island for the last couple days so I knew there would be plenty of snow on the mountain.  As we inched our way up the icy road towards the Cardrona ski lodge I couldn't help but fantasize about breaking a leg or doing something equally as damaging. \n\nAfter renting ski jackets, gloves, hats and snowboards, we were ready for our class. Our instructor, Neil, was very patient and showed us over and over again the proper stance for snowboarding. As we learned to stand on the snowboard correctly I thought, \"Hey! This isn't so bad!\" But that was before we went up the mountain. Once the snowboard was actually moving it wasn't so easy! \n\nOver the course of the morning, I spent far more time in the snow on my knees or butt than standing on the board. Being on the beginner's slope, I was surrounded by small children who would whiz by with confidence and agility. \n\nAll in all, I had a good time and enjoyed trying to learn snowboarding.  I think it would take much more practicing before I could make it all the way down the mountain without falling. Luckily snow is soft. \n"

A hot air balloon basket carried by a flat bed truck blasted 20 foot flames through the air.

While I secretly wanted a pair of these to walk around town in, the guides had other plans. Today we were hiking the Franz Josef Glacier.\n\nAfter a short bus ride, we started down a trail surrounded by rainforest vegetation.  While it didn't seem right that just 2 km away a river of ice flowed down the mountain, our guide explained how the Franz Josef is one of only five temperate glaciers in the world. (The Fox Glacier is another, conveniently located just 30 minutes south of this one.) When we made our way out of the forest and on to the glacial valley, the enormity of the valley and glacier blew away my sense of scale. I could see small blocks of ice at the top. What looked like a 10 meter wall in my eyes actually measured 200 meters! A helicopter hovering near the top was barely visible. \n\nThe walk across the valley and to the terminal face looked much shorter than it was. We stepped over the smooth rocks of the valley floor, crossed glacial streams, and stopped at a point about halfway to the glacier. The guide then explained the steps of glacier formation. First, years of snow gathers in a funnel-like snowfield at the top of the mountain (n&eacute;v&eacute;). Then, pressure from the accumulated snow turns the bottom layers into blue ice - which is under so much pressure that the ice actually becomes flexible and begins to flow downhill.  The ice flows down the valley as a glacier (icefall) and melts in the ablation zone. The length of the glacier changes from year to year, depending on long-term weather trends. If we were standing in the middle of the valley just 250 years ago, we would have been under 300 meters of ice!\n\nMy time finally came - I strapped on my mean shoes and dug into the ice. We started up a set of stairs carved into the glacier and hiked to an ice cave. Michelle and I entered together. Inside the cave, soft blue light radiated from the ice of the curvy walls. It was very quiet. I could hear nothing but the dripping from melting ice.  The cave was so peaceful and mysterious that I could have remained there for hours.\n\nBut I continued up the glacier with the group. We passed boulders that lay tossed about like pebbles.  Deep crevasses cut through the ice. As another treat, we climbed down and wriggled through one of the more shallow crevasses.  Eventually, we made it to a plateau in the glacier. We were nowhere near the top, but the view was gigantically spectacular.  I stood, trying to comprehend the eons it takes to carve out a valley and wondered at the power of what I was standing on."

      "text": "For those of you who were wondering what it's like to rent a campervan and drive all over New Zealand, I thought I'd write a description of a typical day in \"Life in Our Campervan.\"\n\n<img src='/photos/nz_van.jpg' width='200' height='120' align='right'>You fall into a rhythm when you cruise New Zealand in a campervan. Rising early in the morning to frost, we are thankful for the van's heater. Tim, of course, immediately makes thick, black coffee in the coffee press. (Until his first cup of coffee he is not fully human.) We take turns showering in our miniscule shower, then convert our bed into a table and eat a simple breakfast of hot cereal. As we prepare for the day, we often bump into each other while contorting our bodies to share the small space.\n\nOnce we hit the road we enjoy a feast for our eyes. The scenery displays spectacular views of rolling green pastures, quaint small towns, and lakes reflecting snow-capped mountains.\n\nWhile Tim drives I navigate and I am also in charge of reminding him to drive on the right side of the road. Luckily I don't have to remind him often!\n\n<img src='/photos/nz_roadsheep.jpg' width='225' height='229' align='left'>We never have problems with bad traffic, frequently driving for hours and seeing few cars. Then we will round a corner and be confronted with hundreds of sheep in the road. We sit and wait patiently until they clear.\n\nOften we drive 5 hours a day, stopping to hike, browse shops or eat lunch. Tim always has coffee, Diet Coke and gum on hand to keep him alert. \n\nOn this day we leave Queenstown in the rain and head to Milford Sound, a four hour drive to the fiord.  Along the way we see lakes, waterfalls, beech forest, rugged mountains and go through a mountain via a long tunnel.  When we get to the other side of the mountain it's snowing. All along the way there are signs not to stop because of potential avalanches. \n\n<img src='/photos/nz_milfordsound.jpg' width='300' height='206' align='right'>Milford Sound is one of New Zealand's most popular tourist destinations. Rain is not unusual here. It rains almost 6 meters a year! But on this day it was cold and heavy snow is predicted. So instead of getting stuck in this remote area we decide to drive back across the mountain pass after taking a few pictures.\n\nTowards evening we park at a campervan park (they are all over New Zealand), hook up our electricity, and make a delicious dinner on our tiny stove. \n\nWe have grown quite attached to the campervan...kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, living room, and transportation all in one!"

On top of the full-body wet suit, gloves, and caving helmet, we wore purple pants and giant white plastic shoes. As any woman will tell you, the shoes make the outfit.\n\nAfter a short bus ride, we arrived to one of the Waitomo caves - made famous for their spectacular  glow worms. Our guide sat us down and led us through ridiculous drills designed to glide us through safely. Afterwards, he had himself a good laugh and told us to forget most of it. He just wanted to see us squirm. \n\nOur small group hiked up to the cave entrance and climbed in. Our eyes quickly adjusted to the darkness. We walked carefully through the small stream, careful not to pop our inner tubes on the rocky floor. We passed through a waterfall, under low ceilings, and around obstacles. \n\nThe cave widened and the stream grew deeper. When we finally entered an area covered in glow worms, we sat down and switched off our headlights. The glow worms covered the black ceiling like thousands of bluish-green stars. Each point varied in intensity and grew brighter as our eyes adjusted to the absence of light.  The effect was almost surreal, increased by the echoing sound of  water washing over my feet. \n\nThe passage became a cavern and the stream grew into a river. We floated down on the tubes, enchanted by a line of glow worms hanging above us. After safely making it over a small waterfall, we continued with all of our lights off. I drifted slowly, looking up to admire the view. We floated that way, out of the cave and back to the car.\n\nI enjoyed the trip immensely, yet the 52 (11 C) degree water froze my feet into numb blocks of ice. We took a long hot shower and drank hot soup after the trip.\n\nA hot shower never felt so good."

(This is an effort to fight mosquitos which carry malaria.) Importing or using drugs is punishable by death, which is a pretty hefty fine if you ask me. \n\nAll these laws have contributed to Singapore being a very clean, safe country but it sure is different than our US ways. I wonder, what would Washington, DC be like if we used these same strict laws?\n"

We've walked through Little India, down into the huge upscale shopping area of Orchard Road, and all over Chinatown. Like the mix of the Chinese, Indian, and Malaysian people who live here, the colorful ethnic neighborhoods blend smoothly to create a feeling unique to Singapore.\n\nSingaporean people love good food, so good food is everywhere.  You can walk through any food court in amazement, staring at the variety of hawker stands dishing out food made-to-order. You walk slowly, soaking in the vision of the hawkers crammed behind their 10 to 20 foot wide booths, each crowded by dishes, pots, pans, vegetables, noodles, sauces, and 300 other items. Each hawker specializes in a specific food: one sells seafood noodle soups, another Malaysian noodles. Perhaps the person next door is making a specific type of Chinese, Malaysian, Muslim, or Indian food. Or perhaps he just specializes in drinks or dessert. \n\nPlace your orders and take a table somewhere in the cacophonous hall. The hawkers drop your food off to you with \"real\" flatware and plates. (These plates later make it back to the specific hawker by being color-coded.) Only a couple of the dishes cost over $3 US. Most dishes are far cheaper. \n\nThe desserts have been the most fun for me. Most dessert hawkers sell varieties of tropical fruit, shaved ice, sweet beans, and sweet bean curd. I just ate a fresh lemon shaved ice with tangy pieces of the tropical fruit soursop on top. There can't be a more refreshing taste on a sweaty hot day."

Not knowing what to expect but aware it will probably be something good. And our first destination, Kuta, did not disappoint.\n\nIt is like nothing I have ever seen. Bright lights, miles and miles of shops, merchandise flowing out to the sidewalks, almost touching the streets. Never ending streams of motorcycles and taxis pass on narrow roads, horns honking, while music blasts from bars, and venders yell out their wares as you pass - \"You want massage?\" \"You want tattoo?\" \"How about ice cream?\" (Although with their accents it sounds more like \"ass cream.\")\n\nKuta is a commercialized, gaudy beach resort town. The international airport is down the road so most tourists make it a starting point to their vacation in Bali. Cheap hotels, crowded beaches, surfer dudes and scantily clad women make Kuta a typical beach town, but 10 fold. The only Indonesians you meet are the vendors desperate for your money. We are warned we must bargain fiercely for every purchase.\n\n<img src='/photos/ind_offerings.jpg' width='200' height='144' align='right'>Walking through the city is not an easy task. It is easy to become disoriented and lost in the narrow streets lined by high walls. Potholes in the sidewalks threaten to swallow you whole if you aren't paying attention to your step. I must also take care to step over the small offerings in the doorways of each store and restaurant, placed there to ward off evil spirits.\n\nThis is not the true Indonesia. Instead it's a non-stop European party scene. It's an overwhelming, wild experience but I will be glad when I leave. In the meantime, I will soak in the energy around me, practice my haggling skills, and enjoy a couple beers."

In choosing to leave from Johore Bharu instead of Singapore, we saved $160 and committed ourselves to waking at 5:30 AM to make our 11 AM flight. We left enough time to clear Malaysian customs, and ended up at the airport with 2.5 hours to kill. \n\nWhile we stood clueless in the center of the airport, a 60-ish year old Singaporean man approached us. His looked both youthful and grandfatherly: neat and fit, yet with receding salt and pepper hair, gold wire frame glasses, and a conservative light green polo shirt tucked into dress pants. He introduced himself as Kway Tee Soo, and he too was on the bus from Singapore and waiting for his flight.\n\nWe talked while standing in the middle of the airport, then continued our conversation in the cafe. Mr. Soo insisted on buying our coffee when he found out that we lacked Malaysian currency. Though Malaysian by birth, Singapore had been home for many years. He spoke with pride about Singapore's rules, economy, and society. \n\nYou can learn from listening to outsiders talk about your country. Mr. Soo spoke at length about America, basing his views on the six weeks he spent in Cincinnati visiting his brother-in-law. Cincinnati isn't a tourist mecca of the US, but he certainly met interesting people there.\n\nOne such person was the bus driver of an inner city bus, who noticed Mr. Soo following the bus to the end of its line. When driver asked if he was lost, Mr. Soo explained that he was trying to see the whole town. The bus driver bought him coffee during his break and gave him the return trip for free.\n\nMr. Soo witnessed a child in a convenience store purchasing a condom.  The Singaporean man was shocked, and asked the child with a thick Asian accent, \"Hey you, why you need that?\" The child said he had a girlfriend and wanted to be safe. \"How old are you?\" When Mr. Soo found out the child was 10, he left the store shocked.\n\nHe talked about American problems, such as trading food stamps for beer, in a unique sage-like manner. During his trip, he noticed four rough men outside of a convenience store drinking.  In a move that only someone not American would attempt, he asked them the question, \"I'll buy you each a beer. Who wants a beer?\" In a chorus of yes's he made four instant friends.  Mr. Soo was a cunning man, I quickly understood. His next question was not so easy. The Singaporean continued, \"You are all sitting there on good hands, how come you not working?\" I pictured him wagging his finger slowly down the line at each of the four men. \"They just tell me they don't want to flip burgers, but they just sit there drinking. What else can they do? If nothing else, maybe they should be flipping burgers.\" Surprisingly, he left the store without a scratch. Mr. Soo was such a likeable person; I wouldn't be surprised if at least one of the men went out and found a job the next day.\n\nA great flood swept through the Midwest during his visit. The government quickly erected temporary shelter, people volunteered in droves to bag sand, and 40-foot trucks overflowed with donations. As an American, I was happy to be reminded that we can be generous on occasion.\n\nWe parted ways during our layover in Kuala Lumpur. No doubt Mr. Soo is out there now, saying hello to another stranger."

I was excited to experience the town I had heard referred to as \"the Santa Fe\" of Indonesian for its many artists and galleries.\n\nAs we walked along the main road we soon came to a large crowd gathered around a large decorative paper-mache lion and colorful multi-tiered tower. The Indonesian men wore black sarongs, shirts, and head coverings. The Indonesian women wore fancy lace tops and sarongs. The tourists all had their cameras poised, ready for the event to begin.\n\nWe had stumbled across a cremation ceremony. The dead body is placed at the base of the tower to be carried to the cremation ground to be burned. As the ceremony began, the air was filled with music, yelling, laughter, and excitement. The funeral is a happy event, symbolizing the release of the soul to be with god. The men lifted the two large structures on their shoulders and started running down the street in a crazy zig-zag path (to confuse the spirit so it would not return home). Following in the procession were musicians, women carrying offerings, and hundreds of people.  I think the whole town came out for the ceremony. \n\nWe walked through the town, up a steep hill to the cremation ground, surrounded by rice fields. There we watched as the lion, tower and offerings were set on fire. It was surreal to watch the lion's face slowly consumed by orange flames while listening to the ceremonial chants. It was a great introduction to Ubud and the Balinese culture."

Inside of his family compound and art gallery, his batiks and watercolor paintings hung side by side with plants and caged song birds. After brief introductions, the long-haired Indonesian offered us a drink and suggested we sit down, chill out, and take it easy. We chatted for a while and casually scheduled a class for a couple of days later.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/ind_batik.jpg\" width=\"175\" height=\"230\" align=\"left\">We arrived for our class in the morning, accepted an offer for thick Balinese coffee, and set to work.  We were each given a white cotton cloth stretched across a wooden frame and a pencil to lay down a design. I sketched a geometric pattern, while Michelle drew a turtle. \n\nBatik is a process of waxing and dyeing cloth to produce unique patterns and designs. Indonesia is known for such cloth, as the variety of batiks offered for sale in every market here will testify. The process is simple: cover the fabric with bees wax to prevent dye from soaking in and dye the fabric. Like a screen print, the lightest color is used first and is covered by progressively darker colors. \n\nThe wax is applied with two tools, the chanting and the brush. The chanting works like a wax pen. One \"draws\" with the chanting's point as it pulls hot wax from a reservoir. Different size chantings draw dots and lines of varying sizes. The other tool, the brush, is used to cover large areas of fabric.\n\nAfter a few fumbling attempts using the chanting on a practice cloth, I began outlining my sketch in wax. As each layer of wax seals in the current color, these outlines would remain on the finished piece as white.  I worked for 30 minutes, and went on to the next step of dyeing the cloth yellow. \n\nWe continued through the layers of wax and colors. I next painted the area I wanted to remain yellow, and dyed orange. Then painted and dyed through red and blue. \n\nI finished, yet had no idea what the piece looked like. It was a sloppy mess, covered in wax, hard, and dripping with dye. Delaying my need for instant gratification, I handed it over to Nyomen's assistants and planned to pick it up later.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/ind_turtle.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"154\" align=\"right\">In my absence, his assistants fixed the dye with natural chemicals, boiled the cloth to remove the wax, and set the cloth out to dry. Nyomen was showing our finished pieces to a fellow Washingtonian traveler when we returned. She thought the pieces looked great, and much to my surprise, I did too. \n\nIn case you are ever his way, you can reach him at (62 361) 975 415 or rodanet@denpasar.wasantara.net.id.\n"

Our destination was Lovina, a beach resort area in north central Bali.\n\nOur shuttle bus pick-up arrived on time at our hotel and took us to the main bus terminal which consisted of a small open-air hut full of red faced, sweaty tourists. It was still morning but the heat and humidity were taking their toll.\n\nWe all started to pile into an old unairconditioned bus.  I wondered how the long line of passengers and all our luggage would fit. Suitcases and backpacks were piled high in the front of the bus and then spilled down the middle aisle and under seats. What we had been told would be a two hour ride was actually a bumpy four hours. As motorcycles whizzed by and hot air and dust flew through the open windows, I enjoyed my view of Bali. We passed lush green rice terraces carved into hilly slopes, children in uniform returning from school, and an endless amount of shops selling everything imaginable. We sped by masks, mirrors, fabrics, furniture, iron works, food stalls, wood carvings and much more. I know over one million tourists visit here annually, but I couldn't imagine even ten million tourists buying all the merchandise being sold.\n\nWhen we arrived in Lovina at the bus stop we were greeted by more sweaty, red faced tourists. Only they were trying to leave Lovina. They had been waiting for our bus to arrive so it could  turn right back around and take this new load to Ubud. It was a chaotic mess as luggage was unloaded off and loaded on, people disembarked and others lined up to board. Tim and I  moved off to the side to let the dust settle a bit and figure out where we would spend the night. Touts approached, showed a brochure with pictures of their hotel and offered us free transportation. It sounded good so we grabbed our packs. Two motorcycles pulled up and one of the guys said to me, \"Hop on.\" I stood looking at the small motorcycle and then looking at my huge, heavy backpack and shook my head saying, \"You don't understand. It is REALLY heavy!\" I couldn't see how my pack, the driver and myself would balance. \"You can just balance it up front\" he replied pointing to the area between the handlebars and the seat. I'm not a physics major but knew enough to understand the precariousness of the situation. Again I shook my head no, refusing to get on. I could just see my backpack, the bike, the driver and most importantly, myself, sprawled on the side of the road. There was an awkward moment of what to do when luckily, a van drove up that could take us.\n\n<img src='/photos/ind_timpool.jpg' alt='Tim in the pool' width='271' height='200' align='left'>When we arrived at the hotel (safely I might add) Tim did a wonderful job negotiating a rate for a room: 50,000 RP. For the equivalent of $6.25 a night we got a nice room, breakfast, and the use of a sparkling blue pool surrounded by gardens, aquariums and cages with exotic birds. Not bad!"

They knocked on our room door, then woke me up from an afternoon nap by the pool. (I know, rough life.) We eventually gave in to their demands and booked a tour with the cheapest guy.\n\nWaking up at 5:30 AM to see dolphins is a bit extreme, but I would have woken up then anyway because of the cacophony outside. Roosters crowed, motorcycles roared, people yelled, children cried, dogs barked, and Germany's worst Elvis impersonator sang the refrain from \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" at least 20 times from the room next door.\n\nElvis was especially loud, as his voice echoed over the thin baffle separating our bathrooms.\n\nWe arrived to the beach before sunrise, where an endless line of white dugout canoes stretched across the sand.  Our boat looked very similar to the others. It held just four passengers and a captain.  The hull was thick and heavy, yet carved just wide enough to seat one passenger.  Two angled arms reached over each side holding a bamboo outrigger. The outriggers made the other boats seem spider-like as they skittered across water.\n\nWe launched our boat and followed the pack out to sea.  Minutes later, the sun rose from behind the hazy mountains and reflected brilliant orange rays off the glassy water. I admired the view only for a minute, my attention diverted to the spectacle up ahead. A tangle of boats raced haphazardly around in circles looking for dolphins. We entered the confusion in our boat and began to look. \n\nThen it happened - someone spotted them. Over thirty-five boats turned and raced toward the poor animals. The dolphins played for a minute and disappeared. The cycle continued over and over again for 30 minutes: dolphins sited, dolphins chased by crazy tourists, dolphins vanished. I enjoyed the absurdity of the hunt more than seeing the dolphins themselves, even when we became the lead boat and saw them up close.\n\nWhen we returned back to the hotel after a short snorkel trip, we were again serenaded by Elvis. \n\n\"Wise men say, only fools rush in....\""

He extended the invitation in a friendly way, like asking a friend out to dinner. But under the act, I felt him looking at me like a human ATM. When he mentioned the 10,000 rupiah entry fee we would have to pay him, I knew he was lying. But I didn't mind shelling out $1.20 US for a guide to an event that I couldn't attend normally.\n\nWe collected three other travelers, walked inland for about twenty minutes, and arrived to a dusty clearing. Past the rows of motorcycles lay the main attraction: a 20 x 20 foot bamboo square staked into the ground like a two foot high boxing ring. Men gathered in clusters around the ring talking, their bouts of laughter occasionally breaking the mummer of light conversation. Only five women were present, but three were tourists in our party and two were selling drinks. \n\nPaul handed his chicken to a shriveled old man who ran the event. The old man worked quickly, attaching sharp knives to the rooster's feet with endless loops of thin red string. As Paul's rooster was a three-time winner, the old man tied the knives closer to the center of the feet to give the opponent an advantage.\n\nBets were completed and the match began. The old man placed the cocks in the center of the ring and riled them up. The roosters went after each other in a clucking frenzy, pecking at each other, ripping out feathers, and drawing blood. The crowd howled and feathers flew. \n\nThe old man paused the match and placed both chickens in a woven overturned basket, where the fight continued in a confined space. Paul's chicken jumped and slashed the challenger's leg. The old man lifted the basket so the fight could continue in open space, but the challenger slumped to the ground. Blood covered both roosters, but Paul's rooster won the match. \n\nMichelle winced and looked away when an assistant slit the throat of the loser and handed the body to Paul to keep. He held it up, joking about having chicken soup for dinner. The loser's previous owner looked at Michelle and sadly mouthed, \"I lost.\"\n\nBy this time the crowd had grown to over 80 people. A freshly erected gambling area sat adjacent to the ring, and drew the cockfight spectators over. I didn't understand the rules of the game, but it involved cards, numbers, and lots of money. \n\nWe didn't stick around for a second match, but plenty of other events kept our attention. A man slashed three of his fingers with a poisoned knife used in the fight and immediately passed out. Amazingly, a group of men carried him to a motorcycle, sandwiched his limp body between two people, and drove him over dirt roads to a doctor.  \n\nAs a vegetarian, I found the cockfight somewhat gruesome.  Nevertheless, I'm glad I had the opportunity to go. Most importantly, I enjoyed asking Michelle what kind of chicken dish she wanted for lunch as we left the dusty clearing.\n\nI think she may be one step closer to becoming a vegetarian herself."

Once we stopped to ask directions and it seemed the whole village came out to see us. One little boy even grabbed my buttocks! I, of course, gave him a disapproving look and then we both giggled. With all the attention I think it was the closest I will come to being famous. \n\nWe made a couple stops along the way. First we visited some hot springs, watching people bath in stone pools with water-spouting carvings. Then we stopped at Bali's only Buddhist monastery, Brahmavihara Arama. The monastery was very tranquil, with people sitting quietly in front of Buddha statues meditating.\n\nWe returned the motorcycle late in the afternoon, sweaty and dirty, but smiling.

The driver took us 15 km: up the mountain to the rim of Tengger Massif, down into the giant crater to the Sand Sea, across the Sand Sea to another mountain called Gunung Penanjakan, and up a winding trail to the highest point in the area (2770 meters). \n\nAt 5 AM the path to the viewing area buzzed with activity. Along the way, vendors sold noodles and hot coffee; bluish light from their florescent lights lit the path. The chilly air was much colder than most Indonesians and tourists are used to, so other enterprising vendors sold hats and jackets. \n\n<img src='/photos/ind_bromomich.jpg' width='208' height='300' align='right'>We waited in the darkness with rows of other eager people. Minutes later, a thin warm line broke the blue horizon, the horizon grew from red to yellow, and Mt. Bromo's shape took form in the center of the caldera. The sun continued rising and topped the distant mountains, spreading a golden light along the top of the smoking volcano. The light crept slowly down the side, passing the mountain's base and spreading across the Sand Sea of the caldera. \n \nIt was a beautiful sight, worth the price of waking so early.\n"

Instead, Java is much drier and flat. The eleven-hour trip from Ubud, Bali to Mt. Bromo, Java left us exhausted. Not so much physically, but emotionally due to the crazy driving!\n\nRiding in the bus, sitting towards the front, we had a good view of the events on the road. Our bus must share the thin roads with bicycles, mopeds, ox and cart, cars, buses and trucks. Our driver passed other vehicles, at high speeds, by going into the opposite lane, with on-coming traffic clearly in sight. It felt like a giant game of  \"chicken\".  Neither driver would slow and at the last minute our bus would swerve back into the correct lane with just inches to spare before a collision. It was like he was daring the other vehicles to hit him. Many times I just had to close my eyes û it was too painful to watch.  Thankfully we arrived to Mt. Bromo safely, late at night.\n"

What I might consider drawbacks û the air pollution, crazy traffic, and constant noise û add to the flavor of the country. After a morning spent exploring Solo (we arrived last night), we sit in a cafe drinking chai tea and listening to funky music. Out the door I see motorcycles whiz by. A man across the street sleeps on a bench oblivious to the bustle around him. Becak drivers pedal high above their red or blue becaks, carrying passengers. A food vendor goes by with a cart full of food, ringing a bell. Vendors make different noises to advertise which foods they are selling. For example, this vendor is selling satay û meat grilled on skewers. If he was selling noodles, he would bang two sticks together. It is good to sit back and watch the activity outside, while escaping the heat. Observing the people, is it easy to grow fond of them.\n\n<img src='/photos/ind_workerbw.jpg' width='216' height='150' align='left'>The Indonesian people have had a lot of turmoil in their country.

The temple rises above the Javanese jungle in nine levels. The first six levels contain carved stone panels depicting the cause and effect of abusing sense pleasures; the top three levels represent achieving  nirvana through conquering abuse of sense pleasures. \n\nWe ascended the monument in circles, appreciating the stone carvings of each level's gallery. At the top, after playing tourist by trying to capture the moment on film, I relaxed and watched the sun rise above the quiet jungle. It was a peaceful moment; I sat imagining the hands that carved the stone around me 1200 years ago.\n\nAs impressive as the monument was, my mind was elsewhere when we left. \n\nWe watched an audio visual show on the way back to the car.  The show itself was mediocre, but it explained the story of a Buddhist carving from a nearby temple. \"The Bird with Two Heads\" has a bottom head and a top head. The top head gets to eat delicious ripe fruit, while the bottom head is forced to eat rotten fruit that falls to  the ground.  The bottom head complains to the top head, but the top head just shrugs off the complaints arguing that it doesn't matter. \"After all,\" it says, \"the fruit all goes to the same stomach.\" The bottom head eventually becomes so despondent that it eats poison mushrooms, killing both heads.\n\nThe movie depicted the real-life analogy of this story well, starting with poor hawkers begging to sell anything to rich tourists and ending with society's self-destruction when such problems are ignored. The clash of Haves verses Have-nots is clear in developing countries. I'd declined pleading offers from hundreds of such hawkers in the last week alone.\n\nThe minds of travelers tend to dance around such thoughts, but the story didn't. What is my best response to this? In a week at home I make more than many people here do in six years - like the fisherman in Pangandaran who told Michelle he could get by on $1.20 a day with a wife and kid. My airfare to Indonesia alone would be $800\tyet I'm living on a budget and reducing myself to feeling poor in an effort to save money while travelling. Even at my poorest, I'm more wealthy than many of the native Haves. I feel guilty for ignoring the conditions of poverty that cause people to beg me to buy from them, yet I get annoyed when they hassle me so often. I want to help, but how does buying one overpriced bottle of water help the 240,000,000 people that live in this nation alone?"

They will tell you that the city streets are so crazy that you can't even walk across the street.\n\nWe arrived in Jakarta with these stories in our thoughts, but quickly dispelled them as false. Chaotic traffic filled the streets, but aside from the addition of noisy three wheeled tuk-tuks, the traffic whirled around us just like in the rest of the country. The same fumes from small motorcycles sputtered into the air. The same food stalls crowded the sidewalks and forced pedestrians to walk around. I didn't think of Jakarta as a nice place, but I was sure it didn't deserve the horrible reputation that my fellow travelers had handed to me with distaste.\n\nAfter just one hour in the Malaysian capital city of Kuala Lumpur, I understood the slamming of Jakarta. Our plane arrived to a brand new futuristic terminal and a new air conditioned Mercedes bus took us down a beautiful four-lane highway past brightly painted buildings that sparkled with color. A permanent dense haze no longer colored the sky like the one I had become so used to in Indonesia. The streets were clean and orderly. Drivers actually stopped for red lights and let pedestrians cross in safety.\n\nWhen you travel, your expectations rise and fall to the level of your surroundings. When I arrived to Jakarta, I had come from a month of traveling through Indonesia and it seemed like a great place. Most of my fellow travelers arrived to Jakarta from Europe, Australia, Kuala Lumpur, or Singapore. The transition for them was so abrupt that they hated the city, yet I had some time to fall into the rhythm of the city before I arrived and I liked it.\n\nI guess the moral of the story is, if you stick around long enough anywhere, you can enjoy almost anything.   \n"

Individually owned generators supply electricity, but only when the owner of a guesthouse or restaurant wants to run one. Everything on the island crawls at a snail's pace.

Our guide, Ismail, was a local Malaysian who lived in the village where we were staying. After a short boat trip up the river we landed on a sandy shore. We climbed up a muddy, steep bank and then walked down a path into the jungle. It was evening and the sun was setting.  After a couple minutes of walking we arrived in a large clearing.  Many eyes stared at us from the dark shadows of the crude shelters before us.  The batek people live in simple structures floored of wood and roofed with woven dried leaves. \n\nIsmail sat us down on benches and started to explain their culture. They did not speak Malaysian or English, so they just stared and watched us.  I was amazed at the number of children. It is not certain their origin, but they looked African with their dark skin and curly hair. They are nomadic, moving five to six times a year and are reliant on the jungle to survive.\n\n<img src='/photos/my_batek2.jpg' width='250' height='160' align='left'>They mostly eat vegetables and fruits, but also eat small animals from the jungle û barking deer, monkeys, and squirrels. They use long blowpipes and small poisonous darts as their weapons. The pipes and darts are made of bamboo and the poison is from the sap of a tree. The poison is so strong it kills humans in two to three minutes. We were given a demonstration of how the blowpipe is used. A tribesman blew one of the darts into a small target on a distant tree. Impressive!  I thought to myself, I would never want to meet one in the jungle as an enemy!\n\nAs we were sitting there, Tim nudged me to look at a young boy sitting a few meters from us on a log. From his lips hung a cigarette and he was intensely carving with a ferocious looking knife. He looked about 6 years old but had the presence of an adult. Our guide said they start smoking at four or five and work with knives from the time they are able to hold them. Looking around I saw some toddlers playing with fire and others using large knives. In the States, children that age would just be beginning to play with Legos.\n\nThe batek people don't have a specific religion but are spiritual people. When an adult dies, the men take the body deep into the jungle and climb to the top of a very high tree. There they build a platform and place the dead body, wrapped in a blanket and leaves, on top. They believe that when an adult dies, the body is full of sin. By placing the body high in the tree, the rain can wash their sin to the ground and free their spirit to enter heaven. Children are born pure and have no sin yet û so they are buried in the ground. \n\nThe longer we stayed, the friendlier the children became. They never approached us but the girls would smile and giggle, hiding behind the adults. The women and men mostly just watched us curiously, but rarely returned a smile.  It was hard for me to imagine their life in the jungle and the generations of wisdom they possessed about using the plants and animals in the jungle to survive.\n"

Each boat sat 8 pairs of people, two by two down the hull. We sat on the floor close to the water on cushions. Above our heads, a thin tin roof pot marked with holes kept the sun away.\n\nThe 60 km trip up the muddy river wound us through the huge trees of the rainforest for about two and a half hours, treating us to views of half submerged water buffalo, fishermen throwing nets, little naked kids swimming, and houses floating next to the shore. It was a beautiful trip, made perfect on our arrival to the village when the setting sun cast a nice warm glow across the river.\n\n<div align='center'><img src='/photos/my_jungle.jpg' width='300' height='154'></div>\n\n"

It's a relaxing atmosphere to eat while watching boats go by, but this night was anything but peaceful.\n\nWe just sat down and were looking at menus when at the far corner of the restaurant, near the kitchen, a woman started screaming hysterically. I thought maybe she burned herself. It took a moment before people reacted; the screaming took everyone by surprise. The woman's young daughter (about 3 or 4 years old) had fallen in the river and was somewhere submerged in the brown, murky water. Once the horror of the situation registered, people began running into the river desperately trying to locate the child. There was no sign of her. As the minutes ticked by, and no body was found I realized it was unlikely the child would be found alive. \n\nDuring the whole ordeal, the sobbing mother stood in the water, grabbing at the river, the monster who had snatched her child. I stood and helplessly watched. I had not felt this helpless since watching my mother fight her monster, cancer. All I could do was pray that God would spare this little girl's life.\n\nThe men in the water decided the child must have floated under the restaurant. They quickly untied the ropes attaching the restaurant to the shore and pushed it deeper into the river. As they lifted and struggled with it, the child emerged. Thankfully, other than looking a little dazed, she seemed ok. It was all so confusing that I am not sure what happened, but she must have been trapped in an air pocket below the restaurant.\n\nThe evening had a happy ending and I cried as I watched the mother sob as she was reunited with her daughter. But the memory of the woman's screams will haunt me for a long time."

The Highlands is a hill station known for it's cool temperatures and fertile land. People come here to relax, hike and enjoy the views. While in the Highlands we plan to visit a tea plantation, strawberry farm, a honey farm, and hike. \n\nThe road up to the Cameron Highlands is quite steep and windy and it was painful for our bus as it climbed up the mountain, groaning and shaking around each corner. We pulled up to the bus station safely, just as the sky opened up and began to pour.\n\nOnce Tim and I settled into our guesthouse and the rain had slowed, we set out to eat lunch. We found a pleasant Chinese restaurant and ordered. While waiting for our food I noticed outside on the sidewalk a group of men eating the fruit durian. \n\n<img src='/photos/my_durians.jpg' width='200' height='139' align='right'>Durian is a popular fruit in Asia. The outside is green and spiny while the inside is white and fibrous. People who eat durian claim it tastes wonderful, but first you have to get over the smell. It has a distinct, foul smell that invades it's surrounding environment and offends the nose. Often we see signs forbidding durian entry in hotels because of how bad they smell. \n\nThe men seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely as I watched them slurp and suck at the fruit. I had seen durian at road stands, in the markets and smelled it everywhere, but had yet to see the inside. So filled with curiosity, I went out to the street to get a closer look. I was immediately invited to a taste. Cautiously I took a little. I found it had an interesting distinct flavor, but what it tasted like is hard to explain. It wasn't sweet the way I normally think of fruit. But it wasn't terrible either. I could see how one would need to acquire a taste for it though. \n\nThe men immediately decided to give me a durian tasting lesson. So one of them ran over to the durian vendor down the street and bought two more types. Durians are considered a specialty fruit and can be very expensive, so I was impressed at their generosity. Even though my first taste was plenty, I sat down with them and continued to eat. Every time I stopped eating they would cry, \"Try! Try!\" and encourage me to take some more. Soon we were discussing my ethnicity, where I was from, and how I liked Malaysia. \n\nInside the restaurant I could see Tim watching me, our lunch steaming in front of him, wondering if I was going to eat lunch with him. I was having so much fun talking to the men, it was hard to leave. But I had definitely had my share of durian! "

My shirt advertised this condition with a large blotch of drool centered on my chest. My blurry eyes read the time as 5:00 AM. I stumbled off the bus with the rest of the crowd. \n\nThe locals quickly went their own way, leaving us with a small group of dazed backpackers that had gathered on the curb and were trying to pinpoint their location on the Lonely Planet guide map. The conversation drifted to places to stay. One member of the group had a \"great recommendation\". The rest of the crowd decided to follow.\n\nFew vehicles passed by us in these predawn hours. Nothing broke the silence but the occasional rev of a small motorcycle. Streetlights cast a sepia tone hue over the scene. Our group forged ahead like eight crazed villagers in a Frankenstein movie, holding our guidebooks up like torches.\n\nWe reached the castle gates of the guesthouse, but the castle's rolled steel doors were closed for the night. \"Bang, bang, bang!\" Our knocking echoed inside the building and woke up the proprietor, who looked with shocked confusion at the large group of people standing out front. Luckily, we all got rooms and slept the bus ride off until a more decent hour. When we woke up, the streets had filled with color and activity.\n\nFor better or worse, Penang is the cultural opposite of Kota Bahru. Kota Bahru's population is homogeneously Malay and Muslim.  Residents appear in public with covered heads, attitudes are conservative, and people are reserved.  In comparison, Penang's British founders gave the city an international feel similar to its neighboring cities of Kuala Lumpur and Singapore (on a much smaller level). The indigenous Malay culture in Penang mixes heavily with Chinese, Indian, and British influences.  \n\nWe stayed in the center of Chinatown and walked the city all day, soaking in the views of crumbly old buildings with shops selling Indian textiles and Chinese medicines, trishaw drivers who ply the streets looking for fares, street side noodle vendors stirring vats of broth, and old Chinese men sitting in the shadows watching life go by."

With a full week to be productive on a quiet beach, I had the perfect chance to learn the basics of the Thai language.\n\nI worked through the alphabet with my homemade flash cards, arming myself with a shaky knowledge of Thai's 44 consonants and 28 vowels and dipthongs. In no time at all, I found myself transliterating street signs and store names in my head as I passed by them on the streets of the small island.\n\nI needed real help to get farther, so I approached the unhurried staff at Kaw Kwang Bungalows for answers. I soon found myself seated with two women to receive a Thai lesson and give an English one.\n\nThe Thai language is tonal, much like Chinese and Vietnamese. Words are pronounced with a tone that is either low, mid, high, rising, or falling, allowing many similar words to have different meanings. Thus the sentence, \"The new wood was not burnt, silk burnt,\" is translated in Thai as, \"Mai mai mai mai mai mai.\" Correctly pronounced, this sentence would sound like this, \"Mai (with high tone), mai (with low tone), mai (with falling tone), mai (with falling tone), mai (with rising tone), mai (with falling tone).\"\n\nMastery of tones is important when speaking Thai, so I started with some questions I had on the subject. My two friends had different names with different spellings, and yet they were both called Puey. Rather, one was Puey (with rising tone) and one was Puey (with high tone). So the three of us sat around a table saying, \"Puey? Puey! Puey? Puey!\" and laughing. High tones are the hardest to pronounce with westerners. Words are pronounced at the top of one's vocal range.  When I try it I sound as though I am singing falsetto.\n\nI quickly learned that most Thais don't understand tones by terms such as high, low, and mid. Instead they hear them from birth and just understand them naturally. Puey (high) and Puey (rising) were perplexed by my simple questions. When I asked them to place tone markers over the \"Mai mai mai mai mai mai.\" example they looked at me with confusion.\n\nPuey (rising) said, \"Well it is just, 'Mai mai mai mai mai mai.'.\" \n\nAs if that answered my question easily...  \"Yes, but which one is rising, falling, low, mid, and high?\" \n\nThat question began a chorus of \"mais\" in every tone. Puey (rising) and Puey (high) sat and repeated the word over and over, waving their hands in the air tracing the tones like orchestra conductors. The two women were still baffled and consulted the idle kitchen staff, which set off a larger chain reaction. The restaurant sounded like a forest of chirping crickets repeating one word over and over.\n\nThe group settled on one version of tones, which I discovered 10 minutes later in my textbook was incorrect. I didn't learn much Thai that day, but I had a great time not learning."

Most people told me how lucky I was to go and added, \"I wish I could do that.\"\n\nI felt the most sympathy for those with a family and a house, understanding that when my turn came, I'd be chained to the desk job for life. But during my stay in Ko Lanta, I met a Danish family who gave me hope.\n\nSven and Anni were travellers too. Just like me, they were compelled to leave their jobs for a year, sell their house, and leave their old life behind. But they carried much more than a backpack - they took three of their children. \n\nI asked about the logistics of removing kids from school for that long. Svend assured me that their children receive a good education on the road. They learn Danish, math, and science from planned lessons taught by their parents, books, and e-mail correspondence; they learn English and world studies by experience. \n\nSvend spent his previous life as a workaholic. He rarely saw his children and wondered why he was at home when he could be making money. He even worried while planning the trip that he would be unable to relax.  But the first time we saw his family, on a beautiful beach in Malaysia, Michelle commented on how well the family got along and how comfortable they seemed with one another. When I had a chance to talk with him in Ko Lanta, it became apparent that he was not only quite able to relax, but that he had used the time with his family wisely.\n\nI fear that I will return from my travels and get caught back in the rat race of work, work, work. I used to view this as an inevitable outcome in our society to make it as a parent. Now I hope to travel with my children some day. Everything is possible when you stop wishing and start doing."

There, nestled by high cliffs, sat a small secluded beach, perfect for watching the sunset.\n\nThe tide was out, so I wandered on the rocks, exploring the tidal pools. Large purple sea cucumbers sat listlessly in the water. Brown crabs scurried by, red eyes watching to see if I was friend or foe. A sea snake hid under a rock, its tail peeking out. Small fish darted around florescent green coral, waiting patiently for the tide to carry them back into the ocean.\n\nThis miniature world of activity could entertain me for hours, but it was time to turn my attention to the show above. As the sun crept closer to the horizon, the sky glowed orange and pink, each second growing more vivid and brilliant.  The ocean below turned a shimmering gold as it reflected the light above. Soon the blazing orange ball hid behind a cluster of clouds and brilliant rays shot out.\n\n<img src='/photos/th_sunset.jpg' width='250' height='148' align='right'>Sunsets are some of the best of what this world has to offer. Glimpses of God's majesty. I breathed it all in deeply, my senses alive with the colors, ocean smells and the sound of crashing waves. I never wanted this moment to end. But the light faded and dark purple replaced the once glowing sky. Tim and I sat quietly, reflecting on the beauty we had just witnessed. Already the sunset was just a memory, but a memory to be etched in my mind for years to come.\n"

Daily I look around me and I am full of gratefulness. Thankful for the opportunity to travel for so long. Our minds and hearts are growing full with each person we meet, each rich encounter we experience, and each exotic land we visit.\n\nI am looking forward to all the journeys ahead: eating Pho in Vietnam, wandering around the ancient temples of Angkor Wat, Cambodia; trekking in Nepal, and riding camels in the desert of Rajasthan, India.\n\nOf course, we miss family and friends from home and frequently long for a good cup of coffee. But we are still going strong (despite the lack of caffine).\n\nAs I sit here on the porch of my bungalow writing, large red ants are marching across a wall opposite me.  The highway of ants crosses across the wall, up a stick, down a palm leaf on to another leaf and then out of sight. Traveling has given me the opportunity to sit, observe, and cherish even the small simple pleasures in life, like watching ants.\n"

His longboat was old - not antique old, but poorly maintained old. The bright paint that had once circled the bow was now faded and peeling. Small holes in the hull leaked steady geysers of water that the boatman's assistant constantly bailed with a makeshift bucket. Prehistoric millipede water bugs skulked around in schools under the damp beams of the hull. The short fabric roof that would protect us in the event of rain seemed to have only one purpose on a nice day - to prevent anyone over 5 feet tall from sitting up straight. \n\nWe pulled off the beach, rounded a cape, and escaped the tall waves of the ocean by boating down a protected channel. One hour went by. Another hour went by. We entered open water and cruised for another hour. By the time we reached the first snorkel area, two people in the boat were seasick. \n\nAck! The coral was dead. Nothing much to see here, but a few colorful fish attracted by the chum vomited by our two seasick friends. We swam to a gorgeous beach with nothing on it but a wooden fisherman's house and waited to go to the next area.\n\nWe snorkeled again under the sheer cliff of a limestone island, anchoring in shaded deep green water. This dive was everything the other dive wasn't. The limestone wall plunged 10 meters under the surface. I dove in, went straight to the bottom, and floated up slowly admiring the view. Beautiful - the amazing coral formations, bright colors, unusual fish. Everything snorkeling should be.\n\nMy rapture ended when I returned to the boat. \n\n<img src='/photos/th_mangrove.jpg' width='180' height='127' align='left'>Another three hours back - or so I thought. But low tide had reduced our route home to a mud flat. (You would think a local boatman would know these things.) After some discussion in Thai between the boatman and his assistant, we headed into the mangroves. The boatman didn't know the area and quickly got lost. We drove into dead ends, took arbitrary turns, and asked some fishermen in the mud flats directions. It was approaching dark when I saw the assistant wave the gas container in front of the boatman in an expression that said, \"We are almost out.\" We didn't have lights on the boat. Navigating in the dark was nearly impossible and we hadn't passed another boat in an hour. Just as I'd resigned myself to spending the night in the boat, we approached a familiar area. Another 30 minutes later, we mutinied and made the boatman drop us off on the town dock instead of at our guesthouse farther away. \n\nWe had snorkeled for an hour, but spent 10 hours on the trip. We were done, and nothing would keep us on the boat any longer."

We found English language bookstores, Internet cafes, cheap guesthouses, money changers, noodle stands, knock-off clothes shops, massage parlors, and bargain travel agencies under the gaudy signs that hovered above the road. Our conversation competed with the pounding music of street-side speakers, tuk-tuks, horns, and barking dogs. We didn't find any Thai culture, but rather a weird mix of youthful-meets-budget-meets-European backpacker-meets-out for a good time-meets-holiday culture. \n\nIt is an interesting place to people watch. We sat in an outdoor pub with our new Kiwi friend Penny, drank a couple of beers, and played \"Guess Where They are From.\" The rules are simple: pick a random pedestrian and guess where they are from and how long they have been away. It isn't hard. If you inventory their body piercings, tattoos, baseball hat, haircut, clothes, backpack size, overall cleanliness, and body language, it comes naturally. \n\nIf I stayed on Kao San Road for a week, I'd be guessing correctly every time."

Perfect for my voyeur tendencies. Out of the window, directly across the street, is the soaring orange roof of a Buddhist temple. Below is a small alley. Stray dogs, laundry hung out to dry, women washing dishes in large buckets and men standing on the corner are in my view. The alley is also used as an impromptu repair shop, so tuk-tuks and motorcycles stand in line while their parts litter the sidewalk. I have a feeling I will often hear the clanging and banging below while staying in this little room.\n\nCity noise can be annoying when trying to sleep, but it also adds to the flavor of travel.

But my favorite is the riverboat.\n\nThrough Bangkok runs the Choa Phraya river and its canals. Riverboats run up and down the waterways all day long, stopping at the many piers along the river. By taking a boat to your destination, not only do you avoid traffic congestion and pollution but you are treated to the scenic views of Bangkok's river life with wind blowing through your hair.\n\nGetting on to the boat is an adventure in itself. We wait on a floating pier for the next boat to come. The noise the bobbing pier makes as it rubs against its anchoring dock sends chills down our spines. Like the sound of metal bending before an imminent crushing break, the pier screeches in wait for the next boat. A whistle in the distance alerts us to its coming.\n\nAs it approaches the pier, an assistant whistles for the boat to stop. The boat's engine reverses and the rudder turns, stopping the boat abruptly and slamming it against the dock with a bang. This sends waiting passengers stumbling to regain their balance. The assistant continues with his whistles; short connected blasts and long blasts signal to the boat driver to shoot forward, reverse, or stop. Boat passengers, with very little time to spare, must jump to the dock while people on the dock must jump on the boat. \n\nAll during this commotion, the space between the boat and dock opens and closes with the bobbing of the water, trying to eat your legs. As the last passenger is in mid-jump, the assistant whistles and the boat lurches forward in full speed to the next pier. Landing safely onboard we sigh in relief. Another small transport victory! Now to settle back and enjoy the view.\n"

As our taxi driver navigated through the streets on the way to a hotel, I stared in awe at the swarm of motorcycles before us. To the constant sound of our driver's horn honking, motorbikes zigzagged across our path in an endless stream. \n\nThe sidewalks looked like any other Asian country we've visited - outdoor cafes setting up for the dinner crowd, small shops displaying their wares, the familiar street stalls selling local food, and people laughing and conversing in small groups in front of buildings. These things did not overwhelm me. It was the traffic. There was so much of it and never ceasing!\n\nI chuckled nervously, wondering how I was ever going to cross the street once I set out exploring the city. By observing others I thought maybe I could learn a lesson or two before I tried it myself. But unlike other cities I did not see many pedestrians braving the traffic. From the few I saw, I learned I must take it slow, inching my way across the road. Taking slow steps would give drivers enough time to account for my being in their path. Hopefully they would avoid me. \n\nOnce I got over the initial shock of the volume of traffic, I settled back to watch motorcycles speed past us. Women dressed fashionably in silk outfits sat upright and proper on their motorbikes, their noses and mouths covered with fabric masks to keep the black fumes out. A family of four whizzed by, all precariously perched on the one small seat. A young girl, still wearing her school uniform, nonchalantly merged her bicycle into the mass of traffic. I gasped as she came dangerously close to a speeding motorbike. She didn't even give it a glance. I realized for her it's just another typical ride home from school.\n\nSharing the road with the motorbikes are a few cars and trucks, many cyclos (three-wheeled rickshaws), buses, and bicycles. Our driver pulled up to a street known for it's cheap hotels, making it a magnet for backpackers. We pay him the agreed $5.00 and hop out. Immediately I have to face my fears. Our hotel was on the opposite side of the busy road. I looked to Tim for support, but apparently he didn't share my fear for he was already in the middle of the road, weaving in and out of traffic. I took a deep breath and looked for a small space to step into. Tears welled up in my eyes. I was truly overwhelmed by the steady stream of traffic, with no break in sight. I watched an old lady cross the street. She walked slowly and deliberately. The traffic flowed around her like water flowing around a rock in a stream. I followed her example and slowly crossed the street, taking slow, small steps. It seemed counter-intuitive to walk so slowly in the fast traffic. But the drivers could see me, see the pace I was walking, and anticipate my movement so they could navigate their vehicles around me. I felt like I was in the middle of a video game - attempting to avoid all the monsters trying to devour me! I made it to the other side, Tim standing there grinning at me. We both knew we accomplished a small victory - crossing the street in Ho Chi Minh City.\n"

I'd marvel at the ancient capitol of Thailand, at its Buddhist temples, crumbling pillars, pottery kilns, and 700 year old man-made lakes. But we arrived to Sukhothai during the Loi Kathrong Festival, and the historical park was filled with the energy of the present.\n\nThousands of people from all over Thailand participate in Sukhothai's Loi Kathrong  festival. During its eight day life span, this \"festival of lights\" feels like the American Fourth of July. Families spend time together, eat lots of food, and watch fireworks.  The festival climaxes on the night of November's full moon, where participants float little banana leaf boats (krathongs) covered in flowers, candles, and incense across the waters of the old city.\n\n\nWe arrived four days into the festival and watched it grow larger with each passing day, so that by the last day the number of visitors was reaching critical mass. \n\nSo many people! We shuffled through the food stalls with the masses, passing  by endless supplies of noodle soup, cut fruit, balls of meat, green oranges, exotic drinks, pressed squid, and roasted insects. The vendors were doing a brisk business - especially the ones selling skewered meat that had covered the park with a blanket of fog-like barbecue smoke that smelled like chicken. And the noise! The large crowd competed for my ears with loudspeakers blasting music, a Muay Thai boxing match, and a beauty pagent. \n\nWe found a quiet place with a spectacular view to watch the fireworks. We were in front of a ruin surrounded by the water of a man-made lake. The lake reflected the action of the festival, doubling the  silhouettes of people walking through smoke on the other side.\n\nNearby our staked claim, a jovial group people drank Thai whisky and laughed.  One of them asked where Michelle was from and refused to believe her answer. The women whispered and giggled and the men continued to speak to her in Thai. They were a friendly group, offering me a big glass of whisky over and over again until Michelle poked me in the ribs and I finally accepted.  Every time I made the mistake of drinking more from my glass, it was promptly refilled. Michelle and I chatted with them in broken English and Thai until the fireworks started. By the end of the night, I'd been offered lots of whisky, seltzer water, fried fishballs, noodles, a better place to sit, and I'd launched my kathrong with a couple of the women in a makeshift ceremony with a large crowd watching.\n\nThe fireworks were supposed to be the climax of the festival, but for me it was the ride home. The historic park was a  12 km ride home on a songthaew (a flatbed or pickup truck with rows of seats in the back). In this busy hour, most of the vehicles were packed. The owner of one songthaew motioned for Michelle and I to hang on the back of her truck. I smiled, Michelle grimaced, and we both hopped on.\n\nThe crowds also left the park by bus, pickup truck, tuk-tuk, and motorcycle. You wouldn't have guessed there were lines painted on the road by the way drivers zig zagged their way towards home. As our songthaew flew down the road at 50 km/hour, we stood on the edge of the bumper hanging on for dear life.  I felt like an extra from the Road Warrior - and let me tell you, the Thai whisky went a long way in fostering my mood. Headlights from the menagerie of speeding vehicles cut through the smoky air like spotlights in an air raid.  I swung back and forth on the back as we arced around motorcycles and accidents. Wahoo! I was at one with the moment as a little boy in an amusement park.\n\n(Thankfully, we arrived safely!)\n\n"

The rice was in various stages of growth. The flooded fields were being prepped for planting while the tall green ones were nearly ready to harvest. Like they have been doing for hundreds of years, farmers in conical hats hunched over and worked the land by hand.\n\nA constant wind blew against our bus and against the rows of thigh-high rice. As if stroked by an invisible giant hand, the fields undulated perfectly from one side to the other. The deep waves arched like a cat being stroked. \n\nThe line from America the Beautiful suddenly popped into my head:\n\nO beautiful for spacious skies, \nFor amber waves of grain.\n\nFor the first time I understood the beauty of the image, of real waves crossing fields of wheat in the heartland of America. (I'm not a farm boy, so I'd never seen anything quite like that before.) My head rocked gently off the bus window as the sublime irony soaked in. \n\nAfter 31 years, I'd found the truth of a nationalistic American anthem by traveling through Vietnam - through the rice fields of Communist country and former enemy.

It is a place where a simple walk down the street saturates your senses with textures, color, people, and sound - a photographer's dream. We were charmed by it all and spent each day strolling down the picturesque streets soaking up our vibrant surroundings.\n\n<img src='/photos/vt_lanterns.jpg' width='150' height='219' align='right'>The color of buildings in the narrow streets kept my eyes darting left and right. Their bright yellow and aqua paint has faded into earthy hues after years in the bright sun. Red tiled roofs and painted walls have grown green patterns of moss, lichen, and mold - a product of heavy monsoon rains and occasional floods. Big round Chinese lanterns for sale in every color sent nighttime rainbows into the dark streets. Historic homes, built centuries ago in Hoi An's heyday as a port town, have been in families for generations. The dark wood finish of their interiors was as rich as their past. Even beige, the color of the conical farmer's hat, was exciting when perched on top of hundreds of women in the market.\n\nThe people of Hoi An were as colorful as the buildings that surrounded them. I was equally captivated by watching the six schoolgirls in uniform giggle as they struggled uphill riding adult-sized Chinese bicycles. One looked up at me and flashed a wide smile as I passed. Or the waiter in a roadside shack who sold drinks, wearing a crisp white shirt and dress clothes as if he was the head of a five star restaurant. He sat down a talked with us excitedly until our bus left. And Nam, a smallish 15 year old boy who worked in a restaurant. He had the seriousness and resolution of someone twice his age, but still asked me for an American coin for his coin collection and grinned when chided him for looking so serious.\n\nI made a couple of quick friends, such as the four women who gestured for me to sit next to them when I found myself cycling through an unexpected downpour. For ten minutes of rain, we spoke about life in our respective towns. I also met Hahn, the owner of a great tailoring shop that Michelle and I had clothes made in. When we departed from Hoi An, she saw us off with two bottles of water and apples for our bus trip. I met countless other people as well, if not with words then a quick smile and a friendly gesture.\n\nYears from now I will look back on my trip to Vietnam and my mind will drift here. And although my memory might be as faded as the paint on an old building in Hoi An, it will be as warm as the bright colors."

      "text": "This morning we woke up to pouring rain - the steady kind of rain that shows no signs of relenting. The kind of wetness that sucks the adventure from you and drives you back into bed. But today was our first full day in Saigon and we were anxious to explore it. Donning the armor of an umbrella and raincoats we ran down the street in search of a taxi.\n\nOur first stop was the Art Museum. The large yellow and white French building whose architecture fascinated us as much as the art on the walls. The building had tall ceilings, large open windows, a spiral marble staircase and an ancient wooden elevator. Tim and I wandered its three floors for hours, stopping occasionally at a window to watch the rain fall and people dart for cover. \n\nThe modern art on display depicted scenes of everyday Vietnamese life, its people, and images from the war. Some of the art pieces successfully captured the horrors and suffering of the war in the faces that stared back at me from the canvases. This museum, unlike fancy Western art museums I am used to, was old and worn. Without any air conditioning or humidity control, mildew was slowly creeping around the edges of many pieces. \n\nOn the second floor of the museum I heard some commotion near the stairs. Always curious, I wandered over. There, towering over 3 small Vietnamese men, was a huge muscular black man with a distinct American accent. I think his size equaled the other three men put together.\n\nI pretended to be captivated by a small Chinese teapot on display near the commotion û but I was secretly listening to the ensuing conversation of the foursome: \n\nVietnamese man: \"We could take down this painting if you like.\" They were looking at a large painting of a heroic figure waving a red flag in one hand and shaking the other hand in a defiant fist. The figure was surrounded by a crowd that looked equally angry, patriotic and eager to fight. \n\nAmerican man: \"No, we all know there was a war. No one denies this. You can just leave it as it is.\" His voice boomed and echoed as it bounced down the halls.\n\nAs I listened further I heard tidbits about \"the President\" and \"security\". I knew President Clinton was expected in a couple days in a historic visit to Vietnam. Putting two and two together I realized Clinton would be visiting this museum and this guy was security. I chuckled to think here I was in Vietnam, half way across the world from home, but here in the same room was the secret service from Washington, D.C., preparing for the President's arrival. My apartment in Washington, D.C. was only a couple miles from the White House and this felt disturbingly familiar.\n\nThe next issue I heard discussed was whether the museum officials had set aside a bathroom for the President to use. It was amusing to hear him struggle to communicate that Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea needed their own private toilet. I had just used the toilet and knew it was dirty and old. I smiled as I imagined this was the toilet the President would use as well.\n\nMy lingering over the teapot was starting to attract attention so I moved on. Later, Tim and I watched more secret servicemen lay cables and wires on the ground floor, their size equally as massive as their companions.\n\nPresident Clinton, welcome to Vietnam!\n"

Train is delayed until 6 p.m. due to flooding and poor track conditions.\n\n<b>6:15 .,m.</b>\nThree forty-five train arrives. A group of European package tourists boards the expensive sleeper car up-track. We enter the \"hard sleeper\" car with a few Vietnamese travelers.\n\nSix questioning people stare back at us from the inside of our compartment as if we have crashed their private party. They have traveled halfway between Saigon and Hanoi. With people passed out on either side of us on unpadded plywood cubicles three tiers high, the compartment now resembles an opium den. I'm instantly filled with trepidation and I recheck my ticket to make sure I'm entering the correct berth. \n\nWe cause a commotion stowing our bags and clamber up to the third tier bunks. Eventually we settle in to a prone position and give each other looks across the compartment, asking each other with shrugs and giggles if being on this train is really better than taking the bus.\n\n<b>7:15 p.m.</b>\nWe approach a stop in the Quang Tri province and the loudspeaker mounted on the ceiling by my head crackles to life with music and a five-minute speech in Vietnamese and English. In a strange mix of helpful tourism information and propaganda, we learn the details of evil American aggression, heroic Vietnamese bravery, and beautiful countryside near the old DMZ.\n \n<b>9:15 p.m.</b>\nI stare at the white metal ceiling 18 inches from my face. As I contemplate thirteen more hours of staring at the same spot, the man in the berth below exhales a plume of cigarette smoke that mushrooms off the ceiling and creeps around me. I grimace and look down from my berth high above in the cloudy heavens. I see a pile of shoes heaped in the center of the floor surrounded by bits of trash.\n\nOur compartment has six berths, but nine people share the tiny space. Apparently, stragglers without seats are allowed to make themselves at home here, because several men are using the bottom two berths as seats. One man carefully scoops spoonfuls of soft-boiled duck egg from a shell and washes it down with gulps of beer.  Two other men stare absentmindedly out the window and smoke. Another reads a well-worn magazine. I haven't seen the woman in the middle berth open her eyes in three hours. \n\nSo many children throw rocks at passing trains that protective cages have been installed on all the windows. I wonder if any rocks will crash against our car, and in the spirit of synchronicity, a heavy rock crashes down on the roof in a spot close to my head.\n\n<b>11:50 p.m.</b>\nWe have stopped for a passing train. Someone has turned off the ceiling fan and the air has become suffocating. I bury my face in my shirt to filter the smoke and drape a bandanna over my eyes to darken the bright light.\n\n<b>3:00 a.m.</b>\nI can't help but to wish harm on the person below. I hope that a rock will make it past the protective covering on the window and knock him unconscious, or that he will choke on the food his slovenly lips smack loudly. I know I shouldn't think this way, but can't help myself. Everyone in the compartment had finally fallen asleep when he rudely turned on the bright lights to eat and smoke.  Argh!\n\n<b>6:00 a.m.</b>\nSunrise. I don't feel too bad considering. \n\nI climb down from the bunk, crouch in the hallway, and watch the fields and villages come alive. I share brief conversations in broken English with the people in my compartment and wonder which one I almost killed last night.\n\nUnsure, I'm forced to be nice to everyone.\n\n<b>9:30 a.m.</b>\nArrival to Hanoi!\n\n"

      "text": "From the beginning of this trip to arriving in Hoi An I have shown much self-control in shopping. All along the way souvenirs have called my name, begging to be bought and taken home: bracelets from Bali, pottery from Penang, sarongs from Samoa and T-shirts from Thailand. With much determination I have looked away, ignoring their magnetic pull and my money staying safely in my pocket. But upon arriving in Hoi An, all hope of discipline was lost.\n\nHoi An is famous for its fine tailors and the cheap prices for custom-made clothes. The streets are lined with hundreds of different tailor shops, each with a storekeeper calling out to you as you walk by, \"Come in!\" In the front of each store is a showroom of various outfits displaying examples of what you can buy - shimmering evening gowns, cashmere coats, and flashy silk tops. The walls of the shops are lined with bolts of fabric piled high to the ceiling in every color and fabric imaginable.\n\nThe process to get clothes made is as fun and exciting as buying the clothes. After walking into the store of your choice, you are ushered to a small table in the center of the room. As you browse through the latest fashion catalogs, the shop owners are busy bringing you water, tea, or fruit...basically pampering you. Once you pick the style you like, either from the clothes on display or in a fashion magazine, the tailor sets to work gathering your measurements. <img src='/photos/vt_measurements.jpg' width='198' height='175' align='right'>As the tape measure circles different parts of your body, the tailor calls out to an assistant your measurements, who obediently writes them down in a notebook. Then you pick the fabric and colors you like. If you order your clothes in the morning, you return in the afternoon for adjustments and by the next morning your clothes are ready!\n\nWhile it is fun to get clothes custom-made, what breaks down every budget traveler's defenses and causes cash to steadily drain from the wallet are the prices: tailor-made cashmere suits for $25, evening gowns for $11, silk blouses for $7, full length wool coats for $23, and cotton Oxford shirts for $5. Prices low enough to make your knees buckle and mouth drool with desire. Things you never knew you needed you suddenly want.\n\nBy the end of our buying extravaganza, when the sewing machines stopped whirling and the scissors ceased snipping, Tim and I had a beautiful array of new clothes. A suit, coat, silk shirts and blouses, shipped home, will welcome us back to the US in style.\n\n** Note: For those of you who are going to Hoi An and are looking for a tailor, we highly recommend:\n\n<b>79 Tony</b> at 79 Huynh Thuc Khang St. \nWith Hahn, the owner, we recieved top-notch service and clothes!"

Calm water, peaceful silence, and tall cliffs surrounded our boat and for the first time in a few days, the sun made an appearance and warmed my smiling face. \n\nWe were on the second day of a boating tour through the limestone cliffs and islands of Halong Bay, an area about four hours east of Hanoi. With over 3000 islands, the area has become a popular attraction in Vietnam and has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\nAfter a quick breakfast, our boat continued through the bay.  The islands we passed rose high out of the blue-green water in sheer cliffs and were topped with tufts of stunted trees like green crew cuts.  The abundance of shelter kept the wind at bay and the water calm, so that only the ship's engine and the occasional passing hawk broke our peace.\n\n<img src='/photos/vt_boathouse.jpg' width='167' height='300' align='right'>Halong Bay is home to many pearl farmers. Their modest homes float on blue barrels and typically have a set of docks and fish farming nets attached. Many of the homes have land-based touches like potted plants and shrubs. They all have dogs running about. With rows of nets nearby marking the pearl fields, the whole operation looks remarkably like a small farmhouse on land sitting next to rows of crops. The only thing that breaks this vision is watching the farmer row, facing forwards and standing up, through his \"yard\" on an oval woven basket-like boat. \n\nWe spent a few hours enjoying the ride and later climbed a mountain that offered an elevated view of the islands. \n\nThe smile that graced my face at 6 a.m. stayed for the whole day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

While jazz music plays in the background and sunlight streams through the large open windows, we sit, write and sip coffee. All around us are Western businessmen or wealthy tourists chattering away in sharp looking suits, silk blouses, expensive watches and fancy jewelry. On the menu are gourmet items such as homemade apple chutney and butter orange sauce. We sit with our backpacks discretely hidden under our table. In our T-shirts we feel a bit shabby.\n\nI just used the bathroom and came back excitedly whispering to Tim, \"This is a really fancy place!\" and then described the bathroom to him. It had a Western toilet (not a dirty squat toilet smelling of urine that I am used to), the toilet paper was in bountiful supply, no trash littered the floor, perfumed soap and towels were available for my use. Such luxury!\n\nIt amuses me that this environment, so familiar at home, seems outrageously fancy after living the life of a backpacker for the last six months. (By the way, today we have been on the road for exactly six months!) Sure the coffee is three times what we are used to paying and the only Vietnamese here are the waiters. It's not a great place to soak in the Vietnamese culture. But every once in a while it is nice to pamper ourselves to an expensive cup of coffee and remember the business world we left behind."

Nevertheless, I know I'm going to miss it when I'm gone.\n\nIt is the buzz of the Old Quarter that keeps my head spinning with interest.  It was built in the 13th century for foot traffic. The narrow streets now support a huge network of motorcycles, bicycles, cyclos, pedestrians, trucks, and vendors. There are very few streetlights or stop signs here, so people just fly into the intersections, mix around, and spit out where they want to be. It has no rules, yet works perfectly.\n\nThe streets were named for what they sold, so that Hang Hahn sold onions, Hang Huong sold incense, Hang Ca sold fish, and Thuoc Bac sold herbal medicine. Only a few of the names are appropriate nowadays, such as Lo Ren, the blacksmith's street, where welding equipment and hammers spill out into the street with wrought iron furniture and clanging.  \n\nI never grow tired of seeing what the women vendors have to offer as they amble down the congested streets carrying their traveling stores.  Each woman shoulders a heavy wooden bar with a basket hanging from each side. The baskets could be carrying bananas, caged chickens and ducks, raw meat, a neatly arranged array of vegetables, seasonal fruits, or fried dough. It could even be huge bouquets of cut flowers or piles of bricks. With each of their steps, the bars bend under the weight. I'm amazed that their small frames can support so much."

We mistakenly walked pass the restaurant so ended up eating at an outdoor restaurant by a popular night market. We delighted ourselves eating sea bass and asparagus, rice, and a vegetable green curry dish.\n\nDining outside, especially in a tourist area, brought many distractions. Every few minutes walking street vendors approached our table, hungry for our money. Without leaving our table, we could have bought lottery tickets, flowers, jewelry, purses, nuts, candy and musical instruments.\n\nAt one point, I jumped high in my seat when I turned around and found a huge colorful paper-mache lion's head inches from my face. Under the mask were the eyes of a small boy peeking out. The mask was almost equal to the size of his body. His partner, a slightly older boy, demanded sharply, \"You give money! You give money!\" I know it is a Chinese custom near the New Year for the Chinese lion dancers to dance in front of business and storefronts. Giving offerings to the lion ensures good luck for the upcoming year. These clever lads were approaching diners, demanding money in return for blessing. We shooed them away, taking our chances on acquiring good luck.\n\nMy favorite seller though was the man selling elephant food. As Tim and I finished our meal, I looked up to see an elephant slowly lumbering toward us on the road. A man sat on top of him, looking equally as bored as the elephant. Another man approached each table selling fruit that the buyer would then feed to the elephant.  I was so startled to see an elephant in the middle of a city street I couldn't help but stare. We didn't buy any fruit but watched as others offered it to the large creature. He hungrily accepted it with his large trunk.\n\nThis went on for a while until a policeman told the elephant driver that the elephant had to move. It wasn't until the elephant turned around that I saw the flashing red light attached to his tail. The light swung back and forth with each swish of the tail - a noble attempt to warn passing vehicles of this large gray mass in the road. It was a fitting reminder we were in Thailand, land of elephants.\n"

On a flight of stairs above the commotion, I had a great view of the many hill tribe people below me. The Black H'mong women, known by their indigo-dyed hand woven clothes and pillbox hats, were there in the greatest numbers. The Red Dzou women were the most colorful, dressed up with bright red hats of folded cloth that sat back on their shaved heads. All around me, stripes of colorful beadwork, bright woven textiles, gold teeth, and dangling silver earrings filled the market with color. \n\nMy first instinct was to take photos, and I soon found out how little the minority people appreciated it. They all turned, hid, or asked for money. Out of respect for their wishes, I put my camera in my backpack and took photos with my memory.\n\nMany other tourists didn't care if they upset the locals and went chasing after them with cameras or took their photos after being asked not to. They just shot away, like taking photos of animals in the zoo or freaks in a freak show.  \n\nOne Frenchman walked around the market with his photography vest full, the brim of his round hat up pushed up the same style as Ralph Kramden, and his large black camera. He first tried to surprise the hill tribe people by snapping quickly composed shots. They must have been to fast for his Nikon, because he quickly changed tactics and started walking past the women with his camera hiked on his shoulder trying to snap photos without looking through his viewfinder. He thought he was being discreet, but the click of his camera could be heard 15 feet away and his eyes bulged with comic trickery when he strained to look sideways. His behavior could not have been more obvious.\n\nBut the hill tribe people return to the market and put up with this every weekend. Why? To sell tourists hill tribe crafts. I think every woman there tried to sell me a bracelet, handbag, hat, pillow, weaving, article of clothing, or some other miscellaneous trinket. If I showed the slightest interest, eight other women would flock around me trying to sell similar items.\n\nIt is an even trade. Too many tourists spoil what used to be a genuine cultural experience. They then turn their visit into an opportunity to take photos to wow their friends at home, while the hill tribe people sell out their values to improve their poor living conditions.  While both groups walked away with what they wanted, I left with a sense of emptiness.\n\nBut I guess I can't complain. As a tourist there, I'm part of the problem."

      "text": "<img src='/photos/vietnam_skirts.jpg' width='216' height='140' align='right'>Bac Ha is famous for its Sunday market, a weekly hill tribe event that draws locals in from all over the surrounding area. Unlike Sapa, it is not staged for tourists and far fewer tourists make it up this way. (For the time being.) \n\nThe market was in full swing by the time we arrived, so we ended our bus trip from Sapa by passing through a narrow street full of hill tribe people. As we made our way through the crowd inch by inch, the bus driver honked and the crowd parted uncomfortably. Judging by the looks of the surrounding people, I imagined our tourist bus looked, from the outside, like a fishbowl full of interlopers. \n\nAfter making it through the crowd, Michelle and I headed back to the market on foot.\n\n<img src='/photos/vt_bacha1.jpg' width='225' height='139' align='left'>We were struck by the vibrant color of the women's clothes in the market. Royal blue tops radiated from neck to shoulders with thin colorful embroidered lines. Skirts mirrored these lines, adding other fields of solid colors, miscellaneous patchwork, and intricate flower patterns. To top the women off, plaid hats clashed in pinks, greens, and yellows.  With the hundreds of women around me and the vendors selling these colorful clothes on racks, my eyes played strange tricks whenever I scanned the crowd.\n\nThe market was very crowded, but not so large that we couldn't pass by everything once in 30 minutes. We walked with short steps and patience, often waiting in pedestrian bottlenecks and being pushed by little old ladies who barreled through the crowds like wrinkled geriatric tanks. \n\nTo the right of the entrance, people selected tall staffs of sugarcane from a huge purple pile, which they would break into pieces, chew on, and spit to the ground. Over these chewed up chunks, we passed by clothes and vegetable vendors, past huge piles of tobacco and bamboo water pipes, to the meat section, where butchers cut from meat sitting out in the open air and heat. The meat was unusual. Besides the usual items like pigs, cows, chickens, and ducks, the Bac Ha market sold dogs.\n\n<img src='/photos/vt_bacha2.jpg' width='250' height='145' align='right'>As dogs were available as cuts of meat, they were also available live, right next to the live pigs, chickens, and other livestock. It took me a while to get used to, but to many of the north Vietnamese people, dog is a delicacy. Meat is meat, I thought,  but I still became queasy when I spotted a motorcycle taking off down a bumpy road carting a cage full of puppies. \n \n<img src='/photos/vietnam_pipeguy.jpg' width='216' height='141' align='left'>We rounding the corner and pungent fumes of alcohol accosted our senses of smell, from corn whiskey, a Bac Ha specialty. The potent moonshine is decanted by vendors from large white plastic jugs to used bottled water containers. If you doubt the ability of a vendor's hooch to peel paint or light your senses on fire, you can try a shot for free. I tried one later in the day in a hill tribe house û wow! Being bathtub brewed, the stuff is inexpensive. A 20 liter container costs about $12. \n\nCompleting our circle in the market, we passed by more colorful clothes, housewares, food stalls, and horse carts. There was so much to see, so many new experiences. After two hours of walking, my eyes and my head needed a rest.\n\n\n"

      "text": "<img src='/photos/Vietnam_hilltribekids.jpg' width='143' height='216' align='right'>Sapa is a strange and unique place û so different from my Western world. It is dusty remote roads and colorful people make it the most exotic place I've ever visited. \n\nThis morning our small tour group clambered back onto our minibus to head out of town and to trek among the near-by hill tribe villages. \n\nAs our bus reached the edge of town, out the window something white caught the corner of my eye. Looking closer, with a mixture of shock and surprise, I realized it was the carcass of a large dog. Most of its fur was gone and its white body stood out glaringly against the dusty grey sidewalk. Squatting next to it was an old woman carefully pulling out the little remaining fur. I knew the Vietnamese ate dog but this was the first time I had seen anyone preparing one for consumption. While traveling I struggle to keep an open mind to cultural differences. If the old woman had been plucking feathers from a chicken I probably wouldn't have given it a second thought. Meat is meat, right? Still, the sight left me feeling queasy and a little uneasy. \n\nThe bus continued to rumble along windy roads and the views were breathtaking. We were greeted by rice terraces carved into the steep hills, basic wooden houses with small children peering out of doorways and hill tribe women carrying large baskets on their backs as they walked along the road. Deep in the valley below a river ran, stumbling and tripping over rocks.\n\nI was still recovering from seeing the dog carcass when I spotted a group of women on the side of the road gathered around a man and his motorcycle. A large pink pig hung over the back of the motorcycle. It was so big the head and tail almost touched the ground. On closer inspection I realized the middle of the pig was missing - almost in the perfect shape of a square. Confused, I looked at our guide for an explanation. He said the man was a local butcher. He traveled to the houses with the dead pig and the women ordered pieces, which he cut right there. Door to door service! Later, in a cloud of dust, he passed our bus on his motorcycle with the pig still draped on the back, innards hanging out. \n\n<img src='/photos/vn_sapa_women.jpg' width='250' height='171' align='left'>A few kilometers out of town our minibus stopped by an old abandoned church the French had built long ago. Now all that remained was its stone shell. We continued down the red clay road by foot. As we arrived at the first village, Dao women and girls surrounded us to sell their wares. I was enveloped in a sea of red turbans, mud-caked feet and hands shoving jewellery and embroidered purses in my face. At first I declined to buy from them, but they persisted and my defenses broke down. The older women's grins, with only a couple yellow teeth remaining, were hard to resist. Two bracelets and one purse later I walked on.\n\n<img src='/photos/vn_sapa_boy.jpg' width='250' height='154' align='right'>The village consisted of a couple stores, a small health clinic, a post office and a school. With no trees, sparse vegetation and dirt roads it had the feel of a ghost town.\n\nWe continued up a small dirt path, through rice paddies, toward an even more basic village. Thirty wooden houses sat perches on a steep hill. As we approached I heard children yelling and caught glimpses of black forms scrambling down the hill. When we arrived at a small wooden gate, marking the entrance to the village, we were greeted by a dozen children dressed in indigo blue (the H'mong tribe). They stared at us, their eyes reflecting caution as much as curiosity. I am sure we were a strange sight - tall giants dressed in hiking boots and fleece jackets, interrupting their daily lives.\n\n<img src='/photos/vn_sapa_crossbow.jpg' width='225' height='233' align='left'>As we climbed up the hill, more and more children emerged. Most were very young and shy, all were covered with dust and dirt. Any awkwardness soon melted though as the older boys demonstrated their skills at shooting wooden arrows from a crossbow. They use the crossbow to kill birds, rats and an occasional rabbit, for food.\n\nWe were then ushered into a small house consisting of two smoky dark rooms with dirt floors. It was lunch time so several woman were dishing out vegetable and rice to about ten children. While the men work in the forest and fields, the women stay home and care for the children. Over thirty people live in this particular house. At night, they sleep on the floor wherever there is space.\n\n<img src='/photos/vn_sapa_generator.jpg' width='250' height='175' align='right'>One of the more interesting sights I saw was when we first approached the village. In a small stream a wooden contraption was built. It was a hydroelectric generator - on a Gilligan's Island scale. Thin wires hung from the generator to each house allowing enough electricity for each house to have one light bulb.<br><br>"

I arrived with enough time to enjoy the 600-year-old temple's Buddhist library, quiet forest trails, and tall bell shaped chedi. At 3 PM, I walked down to the Chinese pagoda overlooking the picturesque lake for today's event, an informal discussion on Buddhism led by an English monk (hosted every Sunday).\n\nHe looked similar to the other Thai monks in his orange robe and sandals, but the sun glinted off his white shaved head more intensely than from his darker skinned brothers. He sat down in the lotus position and started the conversation with a few minutes of contemplative silence. \n\nHe then fielded questions that participants had about Buddhism, and continued by discussing in detail the themes that emerged in his answers. For the next two hours, 20 people participated in a conversation that was interrupted only by the splash of huge catfish from the nearby lake.\n\n<hr>\nTo know Southeast Asia you must learn a little about Buddhism. So what is it? \n\nBuddha was born a wealthy prince in India 2500 years ago. Though he lacked for nothing, he felt a deep compassion for mankind's universal suffering and renounced his life of luxury to find a remedy. After many years of asceticism and meditation, he realized the teachings of Buddhism, became enlightened, and communicated the Dhamma (teachings of Buddhism) to the world. \n\nBuddha taught that everything on earth is impermanent. In the end, flowers wilt, computers become obsolete, cars break down, bodies grow old, and spouses die. Yet we grasp on to these objects like they will last forever and suffer when they do not. Yet impermanence is their nature - they are just doing what we knew they would. \n\nBuddha taught the Four Noble Truths:\n<ol><li>Suffering (or Unsatisfactoriness)</li>\n<li>The arising of suffering</li>\n<li>The cessation of suffering</li>\n<li>The path leading to the cessation of suffering</li></ol>\n<b>Suffering</b>\nSuffering extends from every problem we face in life, from major catastrophes to minor inconveniences. Like a doctor curing a disease, Buddha asks us in the First Noble Truth to look deeply into our suffering - to ask where it hurts and discover which disease needs to be cured.\n\n<b>The Arising of Suffering</b>\nTo determine the correct medication needed to cure your disease, the doctor must understand the cause of your illness. This you must do with the Second Noble Truth. You must determine how suffering arose in you. \n\nBuddha teaches that universal suffering is caused by the craving of sense pleasures and attachment to desire. His prescription is to recognize desire for what is and let go of it.\n\n<b>The Cessation of Suffering</b>\nYour suffering ends with the cessation and complete extinction of your craving. Following the doctor's advice cures the patient.\n\n<b>The Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering</b>\nTo stay away from suffering, Buddha prescribes the Noble Eightfold Path\n\n<ol><li>Right Understanding: (Sometimes translated as Right View) Cultivating a deep understanding of the Four Noble Truths.</li>\n<li>Right Thought: (Sometimes translated as Right Intention)  The product of right understanding. Fostering loving kindness, compassion, and the wholesome thoughts that lead to the liberation from suffering.</li>\n<li>Right Speech: Cultivating deep listening, speaking truthfully, not speaking with a forked tongue, not speaking cruelly, and not exaggerating.</li>\n<li>Right Action: Abstinence from killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.</li>\n<li>Right Livelihood: Not earning a living by dealing in arms, slaughtering animals, killing humans, selling intoxicating substances (alcohol and drugs), selling poisons, making prophesies, or telling fortunes. </li>\n<li>Right Effort: Putting your energy towards ending suffering by nourishing the wholesome and rejecting the unwholesome. </li>\n<li>Right Mindfulness: Watching your thoughts and actions and directing them appropriately.</li>\n<li>Right Concentration: Developing concentration and control of the mind by being present to the moment.</li></ol>\n<b>Web Links</b>\nWant to know more? <a href='http://www.buddhanet.net'>Buddhanet.net</a> has a wealth of information about Buddhism, from basic teachings to good resources. Also, I'd recommend just about any book by <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author=Hanh%2C%20Thich%20Nhat/'>Thich Nhat Hahn</a>."

Last night people dressed in their best to dine, party-goers sat in bars wearing festive hats swaying to the live band music. White lights hung from trees and bridges illuminating the city. We had a nice dinner with friends by a river and then stopped at a food stall, eating banana pancakes for dessert. \n\nAt midnight, fireworks exploded in the sky sending streams of color cascading towards us. In the distance, miniature hot air balloons made of paper glowed orange in the sky. We watched them float peacefully upwards until they disappeared into the stars.\n\nAs champagne bottles popped and people celebrated around us, we couldn't help but marvel over our last year. A year ago we didn't even know we'd be traveling. Now, 12 months later, we've been to ten countries, swam in four oceans and three seas. We've hiked in jungles, on mountains, along volcano rims, and through caves. We have ridden in buses, tuk-tuks, songtaews, cyclos, motorbikes and cars for thousands of miles. We have seen mangroves, marshes, rain forests, and some of the most beautiful beaches in the world.

So today we begin a two-week course at the <a href='http://www.itmthaimassage.com/'>Institute of Thai Massage</a> (ITM). The first week we will learn the basics and the second week we will learn more advanced techniques.\n\nThai massage originated in India 2,500 years ago, around the time of Buddha. Unlike Swedish massage, which mostly kneads the muscles, Thai massage works the body's energy lines and involves much stretching. To someone who sees Thai massage for the first time it might look very strange. The masseuse uses fingers, hands, elbows, arms and feet to massage and can twist the client into some pretty impressive positions! "

One minute I was enjoying the sun warming my face and the wind blowing through my hair; I was free, free from class, free from work, free to travel the world. The next minute I was sprawled on the gravelly earth, hugging the road as if we were long lost friends. Rising, I found only a couple cuts and bruises although it seemed the road didn't want to say good-bye. Rocks and pebbles and dirt clung to me. My left palm burned with fire. I mounted my bike and rode home much more cautiously.\n\nToday in class, my wrist throbbed and my palm was purple. This is not good considering palms are main instruments used in giving Thai massage. The palms move up and down the body, warming and relaxing the muscles. Today I was using only one palm and Tim was getting a very weak massage.\n\nOne of the massage assistants approached me with Tiger Balm in her hand and a concerned look on her face. She spoke little English but it was clear she wanted to help. She took my hand in hers and began circling Tiger Balm around my injury with her thumbs. Soon tingling mingled with the pain. I watched in fascination as she then massaged my arm, starting at the elbow and moving toward the wrist. She worked my arm's energy lines pressing carefully with her thumbs. Then at my wrists, she stopped the blood flow with her fingers for a few seconds. She raised my hand to her ear and listened. What was she listening to? My pulse? The energy flow? She massaged my wrist one more time and then listened again. When she was satisfied, she moved up to my hand and gave me an awesome hand massage. Each finger was kneaded, pulled and stretched. She ended the show with a slight shake of my hand - to rid the area of any bad energy and hopefully to make room for quicker healing.\n\nThe pain faded quickly and within hours the purple and swelling almost disappeared. It was an amazing lesson on the body and what healing touch in the right hands can do. I am so glad I am in this class.  "

      "text": "The sound of children tumbled towards us - squeals, laughter, cries. I led the way up the stairs as five friends from massage class followed.  At the top of the stairs were brown doors; not knowing what to expect beyond them, they looked large and daunting. I took a deep breathe and pushed them open. \n\nThe room was momentarily quiet as thirty-six small eyes stared at us. Then recognition lit their faces: we were visitors, coming to play. The children old enough to walk yelped in delight and ran towards us. Soon we all had children desperately tugging at our pants, wanting to be held. I picked up a lively young boy with a bowl-cut hairdo, his bangs slightly covering his eyes. All the other volunteers also had at least one, if not two, children in their arms. Victory and contentment from being held shone from their smiles. Others,  still on the floor, wanting to be held, screamed from the injustice. There just weren't enough arms. \n\nWe were at the Vienping House for Babies. It's part of an orphanage serving most of Northern Thailand. This particular group of children were the one to two year-olds. In other rooms and buildings on the complex were housed  the infants and older children. We had seen signs asking for volunteers to come play with the children and decided to visit after our massage class. We entered their world after a short 15 minute bus ride out of town.\n\n<img src='/photos/th_michbaby.jpg' width='118' height='188' align='right'>For the next couple of hours we played with the children. They flowed from one volunteer to the next, eating up our attention. I stood, now with a small girl in my arms, and surveyed the room. It was clean and orderly but sterile, reminding me of a hospital. The floor was hard tile and there was no furniture, only a couple mats. Toys were scattered around the floor- plastic cups, beanie babies, tin bracelets, toy cars and miniature plastic kitchenware. Children sat and played with them, as staff and volunteers watched and played too. \n\nAs I watched to scene before me, I contemplated on what circumstances brought these children  here. Why were the parents unable to care for their children? I looked at the small faces and wondered, knowing there could be a myriad of reasons: poverty, death, prison, abuse, illness.\n\nMy thoughts drifted to the children's mothers. I couldn't imagine the pain and sacrifice the mothers had to endure to give these little ones up. I know if I had a child and then had to give it up, a large part of my heart would die. Even thinking about it made me shudder.\n\nWe played with the children and poured out as much love and affection as we could in a short amount of time. The cynic in me wondered if it even mattered; with so little time, did it actually make a difference? I had to believe, even if it was for my own sake, that the answer was yes. That every hug, every kind word, and every laugh helped the children grow and feel more welcome in this world.\n\nWhen it was time for them to eat dinner and the staff politely signaled it was time to leave, we all reluctantly said good-bye. Once outside the brown doors, I turned and looked through their glass windows. A small boy was still waving and blowing kisses at us, bidding us a warm farewell.\n\n \n"

Forgive me for stating the obvious, but that was one of two thoughts running through my head before the elephant trainer ushered Michelle, our friend Catherine, and me to mount the enormous elephant standing next to us. \n\nWe climbed a ladder to an elephant-high platform where I was 'volunteered' to hop on first. I stepped barefoot across the elephant's broad neck, walked the rear, swiveled around, and sat down on its bare back.  When I looked down, the other thought <img src='/photos/th_elephantfoot.jpg' width='126' height='135' align='left'>running through my mind came through more clearly - my brain reminded me that if I fell from this height, I'd break my neck and my mother would give me the biggest, 'I told you so!' finger wagging ever. But then I saw the giggling eight-year-old boy who was the trainer for the other group's elephant and felt much safer about my position. At least our guide was old enough to drive a car. \n\nThe guide sat on the elephant's neck and controlled it by grunting commands, nudging behind its ears with his bare feet, and tapping it lightly with a mean looking pointed hammer. As we ambled down the road, my legs gripped the elephant's back with the same efficiency of a child's hand palming a basketball - the elephant's torso was too large for my legs to get a good grip, so I had to rely on gravity and my friends to keep me on top. \n\nThe short stiff hairs on the elephant's hips swished below mine and, with each lumbering step, gave me the sensation of being tickled by bristles from an old scrub brush.  Meanwhile, the trainer made \"Ughh, ug, ungg!\" noises and drove the elephant down into the Pai River.\n\n<img src='/photos/th_elephantride.jpg' width='175' height='135' align='right'>My skepticism about taking a touristy elephant ride faded away when we reached the deep section of the river. The trainer barked the new command of \"Bon, bon, bon\" and the elephant turned into a slow motion bucking bronco, dunking us into the cold river and hosing us down with sprays from its trunk. (Brave Catherine in the front took the brunt of the trunk spray).  It was better than any amusement park flume-ride I'd ever seen. Between our fits of laughter and the dunking we took, it was a miracle we stayed on. \n\nWe arrived back at the elephant camp after our 90-minute ride sporting sore bottoms and wet clothes. But the elephant put up with us so graciously that Michelle tipped him a big bunch of bananas.\n\nHere is a sketch that Michelle drew of the elephant:\n\n<div align='center'><img src='/photos/th_elephantdrawing.jpg' width='300' height='183'></div>\n"

It radiates calmness and serenity while simultaneously sucking from you any productive ambition you once displayed. So days are just spent relaxing and enjoying life.\n\nToday's full moon seemed to agree. It rose from behind the mountains as slowly as people ambled down Pai's darkened streets. (We witnessed its rise riverside with drinks in hand.) The moon followed us through the dirt streets and down an alley lit by torches, to the field where tonight's full moon cultural festival was being staged.\n\nA bonfire illuminated the center of the field with a dancing circle of light. Several straw mats were scattered around the field, illuminated by candlelit, so we chose the closest one to the warm fire and settled down for what turned out to be a long evening.\n\nThe Shan hilltribe men started the night, playing local music with their traditional bamboo instruments while we ate dinner.  The music complimented such local dishes as pumpkin and tofu curries, pork, cabbage, eggplant, and rice. \n\n<img src='/photos/th_paidance.jpg' width='110' height='200' align='left'>After dinner, five Lisu hilltribe women danced around the fire wearing a strange mix of traditional clothes and thick Spice Girl shoes. A lone male musician playing a wind instrument circled opposite them in what looked like a courtship dance, wooing the women with his ability to dance and play simultaneously. \n\nOther tribes danced to a different tune, such as the two women in bird costumes who danced to the offbeat music created by a five-foot high Coke bottle shaped drum and five gongs.  What other music would sound better for dancing around a fire with wings strapped to your back?\n\nLater in the night, the hilltribe people said their good-byes and handed the music over to the foreigners. Old hippie, folk, and Irish tunes filled my ears and, for better or worse, made me forget for a moment what country I was in. \n\nThere I sat under the full moon - next to a fire, listening to music, eating sticky rice, enjoying the company of friends, and hanging out with nothing to do. I'd found the essence of Pai.\n"

It has late afternoon and we just arrived in Pai, a small laid-back town near the north border of Thailand, close to Burma.\n\nOur room, a bamboo thatched bungalow, sits atop wooden stilts, overlooking a gentle, green river. Light flickers off the surface like sparkling jewels. Surrounded by intensely bright bougainvillia and large leafed banana trees, I stand on our balcony and breathe in my surroundings. Across the river, children laugh as they run along dirt paths between rice paddies. Farmers finish up another day of work as the sun begins to set and the land glows in golden hues. \n\nSmall coffee shops and restaurants with relaxing ambience line the streets of Pai. It's a place that attracts hippie-types and backpackers, with a relaxing atmosphere that woos the mind and body to slow to a crawl. I've heard Pai is a difficult place for travelers to leave - its charm and beauty become intoxicating and time seems to melt; days turn into weeks if you are not careful. The longer I stand here enjoying the view, the more I understand why.\n"

But I sat down on one of the long wooden benches that ran the length of the craft and quickly put that thought out of my mind.\n\nThe boatmen's shoes lay piled near the entrance of the boat, as they would in any home - this was their house, of course. Clean straw mats covered the floor and laundry hung from the walls near the captain. As I began to get comfortable, 30 other backpackers stomped into the captain's home with muddy shoes. So much for solitude, people filled every available space on the boat.\n\nThe Mekong River runs 4350 km down from the Tibetan Plateau through China, carves the border between Burma and Laos and parts of the Thai border with Laos, continues through Cambodia, and ends in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. It was the dry season here and with the lack of rain, the river ran low and much of the jungle displayed the rich colors of fall - the reds, yellows, and oranges of home.  The river still looked mighty to me as we shot through a fast moving gorge, but high above my head I could see the waterline of the wet season, where the river rocks thinned out and the trees started to grow.\n\n<img src='/photos/ls_country.jpg' width='225' height='167' align='right'>Despite the occasional speedboat hammering past us and jarring me to the present, I spent the five-hour trip looking out of the boat as if it were a window to the past. There was not a factory in sight. Thatched bamboo houses conglomerated on hilltops to form occasional villages. Fishermen strained to cast weighted circular nets over the sides of their old wooden longboats, much like they have been doing since their ancestors arrived. Naked boys played on the muddy shore while their mothers washed clothes nearby. Water buffaloes sunned themselves. Rows of green vegetables sprouted from the sandy shore of the river - farmed only during the dry season when the land is not under 10 feet of water. A team of five elephants, each chained to an enormous tree trunk, pulled lumber down to the shore to an awaiting boat.\n\nWe passed a bright aqua-blue longboat travelling in our direction. Three Lao women peered outside at us from an orange-framed doorway, staring at our boat full of nappy backpackers. I stared back at them from the shady darkness of my seat. Their expressions seemed to question what life would be like as one of us, and I couldn't help but to wonder about the reverse. Our bodies were only feet apart, but our minds and cultures seemed distanced by years. \n"

At night the golden stupa can be seen from far away and, by day, makes an excellent place to watch the mountains, streets, and Mekong River from above.\n\nI met 15 year old Novice Sinethana here while sitting on a flight of stairs. He approached me nervously, out of breath from the steep climb up. His skinny brown body, shaved head, and orange robes clashed with the clear blue sky as much as his timid eyes clashed with his big smile. \n\nWe exchanged hellos in Lao and he began - what turned into an hour conversation - by asking how long I'd been in Luang Prabang. \n\nNovice Sinethana joined a nearby monastery at the young age of four, and will remain a novice until he becomes a full-fledged monk at age 20. For the last nine years he has been teaching himself English and the language of the Theravada Buddhist texts, Pali Sanskrit. He wakes everyday at 4 AM and spends his mornings studying, meditating, and while he didn't say this to me, probably going on alms rounds collecting food and attending to other needs of the monastery. He eats only twice a day, both times before noon. (I met him in the afternoon, so he pointed to his stomach and joked about being hungry.) And in the afternoon, he swims in the river like other people his age.\n\nWe only talked about simple things and, despite our dictionary consultations, he had trouble understanding my English at times. But I loved the way he kept our conversation going by sheepishly reading questions from a cheat sheet hidden in his orange shoulder bag and I admired the effort he put into learning. Most importantly, I enjoyed meeting such a kind person.\n\nThe next time I come back, I hope that Sinethana will be able to have an English conversation with me about some abstract facet of Buddhist thought. I have a feeling that, for him, it won't be a problem.\n"

I sit on the bungalow balcony letting the sun soak through my skin and turn it a couple shades darker.\n\nI hear laughter in the distance and look up. Across the river I see a line of children making their way through the rice paddies. They laugh and yell, run and skip. Older children lead the way and little ones struggle to keep up. I watch as they make their way over the river on a rickety bamboo bridge and then turn down the dirt path in front of my bungalow. Their semi-uniform line reminds me of a rag tag marching band except their music is their laughter.\n\nSoon the children pass under me, oblivious to my watching eyes. The same dirt that covers their skinny arms and legs has seeped into their clothes leaving a brown orange film, muting out the underlying colors. All the boys wear dirty baseball caps too large for their heads and all the girls carry shoulder bags. As they march pass, my heart inside is warmed as much as my outside solar-heated skin. Despite their obvious poverty they skip and play and laugh as children should - with carefree spirits embracing Life. A young girl at the end of the line looks up and catches me watching. I smile and she smiles back shyly.\n\nLater in the afternoon I walk with Catherine (our new Irish friend) down the dirt path to the Riverside Guesthouse next door. I can still hear the children's chattering voices drifting in the air. I am curious to know what they are doing. A large round-faced Thai man greets us and introduces himself as Johnny. Off to the side, nestled by small bamboo bungalows, I can see the children sitting in rows under an open-air thatched roof.\n\nJohnny tells us they are Burmese refugee children and he has donated some of his land to start a school for them. Every afternoon they children come to be taught, hopefully, by tourists and volunteers. His face suddenly brightens as he asks us to teach.\n\nWe wander to the back of the school hut and watch. A woman visiting from Turkey is teaching. I watch in interest as she struggles to teach English words, numbers and songs. Confusion mixed with wonder crosses the children's faces. I can see they understand very little of what she is saying. It is hard to teach when the teacher doesn't speak in their native language. They try to listen and behave but soon are fidgety and bored. So the class breaks into small groups. I sit with the older girls and help them write their alphabet. I write a letter and then they copy it. Next, I write my name for them and then they write their names in Burmese. The strange curling characters of their names look as foreign to me as my written name probably looks to them - two different worlds meeting under a thatched roof. We can't communicate by words but plenty is said through the small touches, nodding of heads, pats on backs and glowing smiles. \n\n<img src='/photos/th_school.jpg' width='240' height='170' align='right'>Later, a Thai man in a long black ponytail teaches the children math and Thai. The warmth between teacher and students makes it apparent he has an on-going relationship and commitment to the children.  I found out later he comes everyday from town to teach the children as a volunteer.\n\nThe sun is beginning to glow its familiar evening 'it's time to relax' light. School is over and the children strip off their clothes and run to the river to play. Their brown bodies shine like polished stone as they splash, laugh, and play the way children should - with carefree spirits embracing Life.\n"

In fact, my dream car used to be my neighbor's Cooper Mini - a tiny British toy that should have been used in a circus act with 15 trapped clowns waiting to spill out from its tiny doors. It is so small I could perpendicular park it on a street full of parallel-parked cars.\n\nBut travel has opened my eyes to a whole new classification of small vehicles with style. What Senator's head wouldn't turn as I blasted past Washington DC's U.S. Capitol building in a three wheeled colorful Thai tuk-tuk? The thunderous noise of its small propane engine, the noise that gives the tuk-tuk its onomatopoeia'd name, would rattle every window in the Senate office buildings. I'd be on the single front seat laughing, with one hand on the boomerang shaped steering wheel and the other perversely tucked between my two front legs on the strangely positioned gearshift lever.\n\nBut the tuk-tuk would be just the beginning of my collection. As the Vietnamese and Thai, I'd need a 110 cc Honda Dream motor scooter that pushes a two-wheeled cart with bench seats. Or maybe one each of the two Laotian versions, the first that pulls a two-seater rickshaw and the second that sweeps its passengers along to the side. The envy of the town!\n\n<img src='/photos/vn_cyclo.jpg' width='218' height='154' align='right'>Finally, I'd round out my collection with bicycles like the Vietnamese cyclo, a one-seat pedal powered rickshaw on which the driver sits behind the passenger and steers by pushing the passenger's seat. Why should I bike through D.C. just for exercise when I can make money at the same time? Of course, I'd have to modify the seat to accommodate fat American behinds, but that shouldn't be too difficult. If the tourists got too heavy, I'd just head down Pennsylvania Avenue selling cut flowers and bread from overflowing woven baskets suspended off my back wheel. I've got it all figured out.\n"

The dots clash with the lines of sudsy white runoff that trail down from the road above and carve deep polluted ravines in the soft ground.\n\nA sunned brown child scampers past me with thudding footprints and an infectious white toothy smile, his homemade kite chasing closely behind him in a zigzag effort to take flight. He screams merrily - as if the extra breath might take the kite higher. For a brief moment I'm sucked into his world and share in the joy of a boy at play. He runs off to join his friends and in a chorus of happy laughter, the hard edge of their makeshift playground suddenly softens to the warm colors of sunset."

But we crossed over several mountain ranges and hundreds of miles to arrive in Chiang Khong, where the air was a little cooler and damper.\n\n<img src='/photos/ls_border.jpg' width='250' height='158' align='right'>Last night we fell asleep to the sound of rain. This morning the air was thick with wet and gray. To cross the Laos border we caught a long boat across the Mekong River.\n\nLaos was a country we never planned on visiting. But after meeting so many travelers who said it was their favorite country in Southeast Asia, we started to think about adding it to our itinerary. Just recently open to foreign visitors it still has the charms of a country not yet polluted with much tourism.\n\nBut our decision to visit Laos was also met with caution. The U.S. State Department warned of a recent string of bombings of tourist spots in the capital of Vientiane. Explosions have occurred in the post office, an internet cafe, restaurants and the Morning market. There were also warnings of bandits on the highways. After much thought and a call to the US embassy in Thailand we decided to go.\n\nSo it was with a little trepidation as I sat on the long boat and approached the Lao border this morning. The low gray sky and midst on the river gave our arrival an eerie, mystical feel.\n\nOnce we filled out the appropriate papers, changed some money to Laos kip and added another stamp to our passports, we headed out of town by foot to find the slow boat which would take us on a two day journey down the Mekong River. With our packs hoisted on our backs we made our way down a dirt road. Chickens and ducks ran across our path and old women ate a breakfast of noodles at small tables along the road, cackling and laughing without teeth.\n\nAs we passed a large white wall I noticed two small boys peering over at us. When our eyes met their heads popped up fully in view, and one of the boys gave us a thumbs-up sign accompanied by a smile. I accepted this as a symbol for our time in Laos - a greeting, a welcome, and a sign that everything would be okay."

At precisely 8:00 a.m. the Thai national anthem starts barking through the PA system, and like God pressing the pause button on his omnipotent remote control, all life freezes below me - the moving stops, the talking falls silent, and those sitting stand up rigidly to attention. \n\nI am amazed from the anthem's start to finish.

There, we will participate in a ten-day silent meditation retreat at a Buddhist monastery. I listen to the calm rumble of the train, the sound of passengers slowly rising from their sleeping compartments and the attendants softly treading down the aisle, selling coffee and tea. \n\nAs the Thai countryside flashes by out the window, I contemplate what awaits us at our destination. I am nervous, not knowing what to expect. I have never been silent for so long. Not only will my voice be silent, but the things I usually depend on to distract me from myself will not be available either - television, radio, books, and writing. So it will just be my thoughts and me. I wonder if I will enjoy my company or drive myself crazy. I realize that in my 30 years I have rarely been alone for long periods of time. So as the train pulls into the Chaiya station I am filled with some apprehension, but mostly curiosity, of what the next ten days will offer.\n\nIt is 8 a.m. and we are some of the first participants to arrive and register at the International Dhamma Hermitage. It is part of the Suanmok Buddhist monastery but this center is set aside for foreigners.  The main monastery is a couple kilometers down the road. The center grounds used to be a coconut plantation so the grounds are covered with row after row of palm trees, as well as banana, papaya and Banyan trees. I am immediately struck at the peacefulness of the place.\n\nBefore we register I am handed a list of guidelines to read and agree upon. They include: we will rise every morning at 4 a.m. and go to sleep at 9 p.m.; men and women will sleep in separate dorms and eat on different sides of the dining hall; we will only eat twice a day (first at 8 in the morning and then at 12:30 noon); when bathing, we must stay covered. Women should wear a sarong and men should wear shorts. We are asked to dress modestly, making sure our shoulders and knees are covered. We are asked to watch out for poisonous snakes, scorpions, and centipedes (especially in our beds). And of course, no talking, not writing, not reading, and no note passing. \n\nI register and then go to explore my living quarters. A large, enclosed brick building, resembling a fort greets me. The inside of the building has a large communal courtyard with a grassy field. Rooms open into the courtyard and wells for bathing and laundry are spaced in the four corners and 3 sides. I do as I am instructed and take one wooden pillow, one mosquito net, a bamboo mat and a blanket. My room is nothing but a concrete square with a concrete bed, but it is actually much cleaner than many of the guesthouses we have been staying in on this trip.\n\nAfter situating ourselves, we head back into town to do last minute errands. Upon returning we talk to a few others as they arrive. There is an excited giddiness in the air. People are nervous, curious, and wary. It feels like we are entering a grown-up summer camp.\n\nIn our final moments before the retreat starts, Tim and I sit together trying to use words we will silence in the next hour. But not much comes. Already our hearts and minds are becoming more still, preparing for solitude. We wonder what it will be like to be separated after spending 8 months constantly together. \n\nOne hundred and forty people have arrived from all over the world. We sit in a large open hall, surrounded by palm trees, sand, and three ponds. People sit on their own square cushion on the cement floor, where we will sit for the next ten days. A bell is rung. The silence begins.\n\n\n"

It is refreshing to be in a group of 140 people and yet there is no opportunity for cliques, no competition for attention and no insensitive statements. Usually in a large group, the louder ones dominate. But here, we are all individuals in the same boat, on the same level. It is refreshing. \n\nSo often we talk and never really listen to the words we speak. We spend much of our lives using words to impress, flatter, and convince. The silence has helped me look inside and my mind is able to reflect more deeply and listen on a deeper level.\n\nWithout words to clutter the air and mind, other sounds have emerged much louder. The sounds of nature have come alive! There is a symphony going on around us. Fish splash in the pond, birds sing melodies and leaves rustle with rhythm. Dragonflies hum, crickets fiddle tunes and frogs croak in harmony to the beat of the gecko's cry. All with the finale of a \"boom!\" as a coconut falls to the ground from high above.\n\nListening to nature, for days on end, has made my heart skip with delight.\n"

The children piled on top of him, clambering for attention. He handled it really well!\n\nCher, a friend from our massage class, was also there. She is from Maryland and we have enjoyed hanging out with someone from so close to home. As a professional massage therapist, she was in Chiang Mai to take several massage classes.\n\nIt was Sunday, a day most of the staff at the orphanage takes off, so the volunteers were extra busy with the little ones. We took them outside to play and brought them in for a bowl of rice porridge around lunchtime. Most of the children could feed themselves and we helped the ones that couldn't. \n\nAfter lunch, we set up a conveyor belt-like system to give the children baths. A volunteer would strip a child of their clothes and then pass him/her to another adult at a large sink. There the children were soaped up and rinsed off and then handed to another adult to be dried. Each child was then passed to a counter to be dressed in clean clothes. It was very efficient and in no time all 18 children were ready for their afternoon nap.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/th_cher1.jpg\" width=\"147\" height=\"240\" align=\"left\">One little girl though stopped the flurry of activity in its tracks. She had been very quiet and still on her mat and no one had really paid much attention to her. Sometimes, unfortunately, it is the loud children who get the attention while the quiet ones are overlooked. But when we undressed her for her bath we were shocked at how skinny she was. Her body was frightfully thin and frail. One volunteer, who had been coming for three months, was outraged the little girl had deteriorated so badly. She informed us the girl had arrived a month ago, healthy and plump. Now she was just a shadow. \n\nIt was obvious she was suffering from emotional trauma from the sudden separation from her mother/parents. The staff, with so many children to look after, was not able to give her the attention she needed. In her grief, she was withdrawing û not eating or interacting. She needed more than what the staff could give.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/th_cher2.jpg\" width=\"116\" height=\"200\" align=\"right\">Cher asked for some olive oil and then, using her massage therapist background, began to give the baby a massage. For the next 20 minutes I watched her hands slide up and down, stroking and touching. Cher explained how essential touches is to human survival and that at an early age if infants do not receive enough tactile stimulation, they can literally whither and die. It's called the 'failure to thrive' syndrome. Children can have their basic necessities like food and shelter met, but without touch they will not survive. \n\nAs Cher's hands massaged, her mouth also worked, showering the girl with soft whispers of love. Slowly the baby's whole being transformed. Her body went from a tight angry ball to a relaxed comforted child. Her facial muscles loosened and a smile emerged. \n\n<img src=\"/photos/th_babies.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"135\" align=\"left\">The other children were all lying on their mats falling asleep but the child whimpered and cried when Cher went to lie the little girl down. She was not ready for the touch to stop. So Cher sat and rocked her until sleep arrived. \n\nThe hand is an amazing conveyer of information. There is power in touch. Power to convey love û to hold, to stroke, to nurture. Watching Cher work was a testament to the power of loving touch.\n\n\n"

      "text": "The journey of self-discovery is a hard one. By the end of our retreat at Suan Mohhk, our 140-member group had dwindled down to a mere 100. Forty people couldn't handle something - the silence, the solitude, the concrete beds, the message, the no smoking policy, or the infrequent mealtimes. Or just maybe, they just didn't like themselves as company.\n\n\nI understand their feelings perfectly. There were many times this week where I wanted nothing more than to flee the retreat and go to the beach. But these times were mixed with happiness and determination - and that is what kept me working on my mind instead of my tan.  When I look back at my journal entries, entries that range from cursing anger to unbridled joy, I can clearly view my normally stable personality vacillating between extremes. \n\nBut we didn't meditate about childhood or problems, but rather to watch our minds in action - to watch the cause and effect of our thoughts as they arose. We can compare this meditation to the passive act of watching television. If you watch enough TV you eventually begin to understand where the plot is going to lead before the show ends.\n\nI learned you can do the same thing with your mind - if you watch it carefully enough, you can know where it is going, and if you desire, control the outcome."

But that left 19.5 hours between meals with nothing more than a cup of soymilk in the evening. As someone a dietician would call a grazer, I feared growing hungry between meals and ate too much at mealtimes for the first couple of days.\n\nBut Buddhism teaches moderation and mindfulness: moderation to eat just what is needed to live a healthy life and mindfulness to enjoy each bite of food fully. Over the 10-day course their lessons sank in - I took less food and enjoyed what I ate more. I experimented until I knew how much food I needed to keep me satisfied and found out that I needed far less than what I was used to eating. And by the end of the retreat, despite deliciously rich coconut curries and 23 hours a day of inactivity, I've lost 5-10 pounds and I feel wonderful.\n"

Most of our two weeks here has been spent floating on top of the river, walking on its banks, or watching people work and play in its water.\n\nLaos has the smallest population density in Southeast Asia and it is evident in the quiet streets, lack of development and laid-back atmosphere. The small town of Vang Vieng is no exception. A couple hours north of Vientiane (Laos' capitol), life here is as slow as the river which flows through it.\n\nWhile in Vang Vieng we explored hill tribe villages, balanced over thin bridges (made of two bamboo poles tied together), and walked four kilometers deep into a cave to swim in its pools by candlelight. In the late afternoon we sat lazily in black inner tubes as the river carried us downstream. Water buffalo watched us with indifference, submerging their heads underwater when the flies became too bothersome. Children played, women bathed, and men fished. We enjoyed soaking in the simple, quiet life of the people here.\n"

Picture the Chinese Buddha with his round robust tummy happily protruding and his smile of contentment. This is what we are starting to resemble. Often Tim and I pat each other's stomachs and call each other \"our little Buddha.\" We have consumed countless fruit shakes, banana pancakes, and bowls of noodle soup.\n\nThai food in particular has captured our heart and stomachs. It is a wonderful mixture of sweet and sour, hot and salty flavors. We have feasted on Tom Yum soup, Phad Thai noodles, green curry, and coconut curry. Upon returning home we want to continue eating Thai cuisine so we took a cooking class at the Sompet Thai Cookery School.\n\nThe school was a few miles outside of Chiang Mai nestled in a garden by a river. It was an oasis from the hustle and bustle of the city. Our teacher, Mrs. Busara, was a spunky Thai woman overflowing with energy. She gave us a tour of the garden while throwing interesting food facts our way. We walked among cumin, mint, leeks, turmeric, ginger, garlic, chives, lemon grass, basil, eggplant, peppers, and mushrooms.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/th_cooking.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"160\" align=\"right\">After the garden tour, we set to work and the next couple hours were a whirlwind of cooking activity - chopping, slicing, cutting, pounding, stirring. We made green curry paste, Phad Thai, fish cake, coconut milk soup with chicken, hot and sour prawn soup, and dipping sauces. Each student had their own work area and stove to cook. When all the food was ready, we settled down to enjoy a beautiful feast. Yum!\n"

Who ever knew meditation could be so hard?\n\nAs we stood outside the retreat center along a highway waiting for a bus, cars and trucks zoomed by. The world was brighter, louder, and busier than I remembered. Now we were headed to Ko Samui, an island not far away, to relax on its beautiful beaches.\n\nFrom the minute Tim and I were reunited our mouths gushed with words. I was astonished at what different experiences we had. For the one-hour bus ride, two hour ferry ride, 45-minute taxi ride, and then late into the night, we talked. We shared our experiences, thoughts, ideas, and observations. We talked philosophy, religion, spirituality, and the meaning of life. We agreed that, although the retreat was difficult at times, the insights we gained were very valuable. \n\nKo Samui is one of Thailand's most popular beach resorts. I can understand why with its turquoise water, fine sand beaches, fancy hotels and restaurants. We will spend the next couple of days here soaking in the sun's rays, swimming, writing, and reading. \n"

And even at their slow pace, they churn up red dust clouds that permanently hover between the high security walls that line our street.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/cam_street.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"126\" align=\"right\">Phnom Penh is a living version of America's wild west. Except here, moto drivers are the new cowboys. They've traded in horses for Honda motorcycles, cowboy hats for baseball caps, and cattle for passengers, but  their spirit is the same - harsh lives of long hours and hard work. Like horses in front of watering troughs, their motorcycles congregate outside of restaurants, on street corners, and near markets, patiently waiting for the next fare.\n\n\n<img src=\"/photos/seasia_corner.jpg\" width=\"288\" height=\"190\" align=\"left\">Like the wild west, there is a feeling of lawlessness in Phnom Penh that is both freeing and oppressive. It is a place where traffic never stops - the vehicles move into the intersections and right of way is determined by size and speed.  It is a place where the low police salary of $20 a month forces every lawmaker to take bribes, so that a man with money can pay his way out of any small trouble with ease. It is a place where limbless land mine victims beg in the dirt street next to a corrupt official's new model Mercedes sedan. It is a place where \"happy\" pizzas from Happy Herbs Pizza are topped with a special ingredient that is illegal to posses in most countries, and where people can fire machine guns, throw grenades, visit huge brothel areas, and sing all night in the wild west equivalent of a saloon - the karaoke bar.\n\nA sign on our guesthouse wall warns us not walk around after dark or with valuables. In this wild west, it is hard to see what trouble lurks around the next dark corner.\n\nThis atmosphere thrives today thanks to 30 years of Cambodian troubles - the American bombings during the Vietnam war, the Khmer Rouge genocide of 1-3 million Cambodian people, the Vietnamese occupation, the years of Cambodia civil war, and the current corrupt government. But now that peace has arrived, foreign aid and investment is slowly helping Cambodia enter the modern world. During our stay in Phnom Penh, we drove on a new US financed highway and heard much excitement about a new Japanese financed highway. We passed several new clothing factories that promise to offer new jobs, and conversely, met a newly arrived labor union organizer who helps these garment workers receive fair wages. Medical care in Cambodia is terrible - 1 in 5 children die before the age of 5 and life expectancy is a meager 51.6 years, but foreign funded hospitals are now beginning to offer free medical care to the needy. \n\nThe city is full of western expatriates teaching English, working for aid organizations, and setting up new business ventures. It is an exciting time to be here."

The 3-story buildings, surrounded by thick walls and barbed wire, were once a children's school.  But in 1976 the Khmer Rouge regime converted it into a prison called Security Office 21 (S-21). Used for interrogating and torturing those the KR deemed as opposition, over 17,000 people passed through the prison before being exterminated at the famous Killing Fields outside of town. \n\nThe museum grounds were peaceful as birds sang in plumeria trees and sunshine reflected off playground equipment sitting in a grassy area. Yet there was a disturbing quiet in the air. Disturbing because I knew in this place so many lives were silenced and that the present quiet seemed only to scream the past horrors.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/cam_toulsleng_photo1.jpg\" alt=\"Toul Sleng face\" width=\"125\" height=\"142\" align=\"right\">Touring the museum was a sad and sobering experience. On exhibit were rooms used for torture and classrooms converted into cells to house the prisoners. The Khmer Rouge took pictures of every person who entered S-21 and the museum displayed their black and white portraits row after row and room after room. Haunting faces of men, women, and children lined the walls, their eyes telling stories of pain, defiance, terror, or resignation to their fate. Tourists walked around the displays numbly, trying to comprehend how and why fellow humans could be so cruel to one another.\n\nIt was a sobering experience and a vivid reminder of the atrocities that had occurred not too long ago here in Cambodia.\n\n<div align='center'><img src='/photos/seasia_faces.jpg' width='201' height='288' alt='Toul Sleng faces'></div>"

The concentration of so many excellent ancient Buddhist and Hindu temples is staggering and, despite the thousands of tourists that visit each year, the mysterious Khmer ruins still offer travelers the opportunity to feel like Indiana Jones.\n\nI had one such Indiana Jones moment in Bayon - one of the most popular temples in the area. \n\nWe arrived before sunrise, a time when the darkness of early morning veils the massive stone monument in mystery. I walked past the famous bas-reliefs that depict historic wars and everyday life and approached the first level of stairs, which were as steep as the pyramid at Chichen Itza and worn uneven by 800 years of use and decay. They led me right into the maze-like passages and temple rooms that I had come to see. I began to feel like the first person to enter the pyramids in Egypt - a tomb raider, perhaps. In my fascination, I quickly lost Michelle and our friend John, but I didn't mind. I was grateful to experience this rare moment of solitude in such a heavily visited monument. \n\nI ascended another flight of stairs to the third and top level, which features a large stupa surrounded by square towers depicting the face of King Jayavarman VII on all sides.  In the faint light, I had to squint to see his soft features and wise smile. But with over 200 portrait carvings at the top of Bayon, his face greeted me at every turn. \n\n<img src='/photos/cam_bayon2.jpg' width='257' height='200' align='right'>Reverberating chirps from bats in the central stupa echoed from the stone walls and called me in through an eerie doorway to investigate. The smell of bat guano was a little overpowering, but I toughed it out and walked deeper into the cavern. The sweep of my flashlight across the high ceiling caused swarms of bats to flutter around inside. I watched nervously until one almost hit me in the face and I yelped like a little girl. After I finished laughing at myself, I ducked and ran through.\n\nI found Michelle and John about the same time the other tourists arrived to spoil my fantasy, but Bayon was no less fantastic in the rising sun. The soft orange light of morning across the ancient rock stopped me in my tracks and forced me to sit in silent appreciation.\n\n<hr>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"100%\"><tr valign='top'><td colspan=2></td></tr><tr valign='top'><td>Siem Reap street in morning:</td><td><img src='/photos/seasia_street.jpg' width='288' height='193'></td></tr><tr valign='top'><td colspan=2><hr></td></tr><tr valign='top'><td>Siem Reap Crock Farm:</td><td><img src='/photos/seasia_crocs.jpg' width='144' height='216'></td></tr><tr valign='top'><td colspan=2><hr></td></tr><tr valign='top'><td>A temple inside Angkor Wat:</td><td><img src='/photos/seasia_stacktemple.jpg' width='216' height='142'></td></tr><tr valign='top'><td colspan=2><hr></td></tr><tr valign='top'><td>A temple surrounded by trees:</td><td><img src='/photos/seasia_treetemple.jpg' width='288' height='192'></td></tr><tr valign='top'><td colspan=2><hr></td></tr></table> \n"

I'd heard it was actually possible there to shoot a rocket-propelled grenade and I obviously couldn't let such an opportunity pass me by.  \n\n\"So how was it?\" I asked a 20-something Brit as he was leaving. He replied, \"The machine gun was brilliant, but I'd give the grenades a miss.\" This was definitely going to be fun.\n\nWe sat on plastic chairs around a folding table and took a look at the \"menu\". Thirty rounds with an AK-47: $30. Thirty rounds with an M-16: $30. One grenade: $20. (Could I get that to go? Maybe that would be a bad idea!) One hundred rounds with a tommy gun (think gangsters): $70. Various pistols and other weapons were also listed, but no rocket launcher. How disappointing! I was sure there was a juicy story behind the discontinuation of the rocket launcher option. Perhaps someone launched one at a car or fired it backwards. I asked three Cambodians and received three different stories - and none of the stories were all that exciting. One said the shells were too expensive and loud, one suggested that they didn't have enough room, and the last just said, \"not possible.\" I wondered if it had anything to do with the go-kart track on the other side of the firing range or our close proximity to the airport. But for whatever reason, my plan was thwarted.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/cam_ak47.jpg\" alt=\"Tim with AK-47\" width=\"200\" height=\"151\" align=\"right\">I ordered the AK-47 and received one Russian-made rifle with folding stock and a clip full of ammo. But then I was told I'd have to fire it in semi-automatic mode. So many rules here in Cambodia - I might as well be home! If I wanted to fire a machine gun I'd have to shell out $70, and that price was much too high for a few seconds of craziness. So I fired my 30 rounds at a target 50 meters away. I'm no Rambo, but I still hit the target 27 out of 30 times and even scored a dead on bulls-eye. The Cambodian who added up my score seemed impressed - apparently I scored really well for a tourist."

It is one of the Angkor temples left to the mercy of the jungle. Huge trees grow out of crumbling walls, roots and vegetation entwine with rocks, and green moss carpets carvings. The temple is a giant maze of fallen boulders, inviting archways, and passageways leading to small rooms and dead ends.\n\nTim and I split up to explore alone. Ta Prohm is a place that invites solitude. Walking through the ruins I get a taste of what the early French explorers found when they first encountered the Angkor temples. It's only nine in the morning but I am already dripping in sweat. The jungle air is hot, moist, and still. Even though thousands have visited this temple, the magic and mystery of the ruins make my heart beat faster, and I feel as if I am the first to explore it. Around each corner lies new discoveries - intricate carvings, toppled sculptures, rich textures, clawing tree roots, and dancing shadows along courtyard walls. \n\n<img src=\"/photos/cam_hall.jpg\" width=\"174\" height=\"250\" align=\"left\">I enter a small room. Its roof is now a pile of rocks at my feet. Down a dark connecting passageway I see a young Cambodian man watching me. With so many doors and corridors inviting me through them I am not sure where to go next. The man beckons me towards him and in broken English tells me there is a beautiful carving nearby. Before I can answer he disappears around the corner. I hesitate to follow. There is no one else around and to follow this stranger might invite trouble. But the magic of the place has made me more adventurous and I follow.\n\nAs I approach him I realize he is more a young teenager than a man. His clothes are ragged and dirty and one of his arms is lame, hanging loose at his side like a thin, brown twig. He grins at me and points to a small nook. <img src=\"/photos/cam_statue.jpg\" width=\"148\" height=\"250\" align=\"right\">A shaft of light falls through a hole in the roof and perfectly spotlights a beautiful carvings of a Khmer dancer. She stares at me with a seductive and playful smile. In the sunlight the rock glows, as if golden. I snap a photo and my new-found guide continues on. Each of his steps is firm and sure while mine our cautious and slow. I wonder how many snakes live in the dark holes I am stepping over and how many rocks over my head are ready to topple.  My guide waits patiently as I climb up and over huge rocks. Soon we emerge on top of a roof and walk along its arch. From this height I am face to face with carved horses and chariots, demons and gods, mythical creatures, and dancing women. In silence we walk as he points to beautiful sights I never would have found on my own.\n\nWhen we eventually reach the main enterance again I can see Tim in the distance busily taking photos. This is a photographer's heaven. I give the boy a small tip and thank him for a tour I will never forget.\n"

As I turned to face him he sputtered and coughed and then turned red. Then, in his thick Indian accent said, \"Never mind. I thought you were a boy, not a girl.\" He had been trying to save me from an embarrassing situation but instead put himself right in the middle of one. I smiled graciously, pointed to my hair and said, \"Short hair!\" We both smiled awkwardly and I continued on my way.\n\nI think I will look into buying a skirt."

The palace covers an entire island in middle of the lake and its imposing white walls rise straight from the lake's surface on all sides. With its majestic arched windows and stylish domed roofs, the palace has all the charm of a floating fairytale castle. The effect is even more stunning at night, when its brilliant white reflection glows off the lake's surface. \n\nThe Lake Palace Hotel is a bit too pricey for us with the cheap rooms running $210 a night, but dinner is well within our means. So after inquiring about their dress code, I shaved three days of beard from my face, put on my least dirty pair of travel pants, scraped the many layers of cow dung from my Teva sandals, and took the boat with Michelle out to one of the world's most luxurious hotels. \n\nI made it safely past the doorman and spotted a few other backpackers with the same idea - so I didn't feel too out of place. The buffet-style meal featured both western and Indian food and included tables full of salads, breads, entrees, soup, desserts, and more. I certainly don't eat poorly as a budget traveler, but do you know how long it has been since I had a martini and smoked salmon? After two trips  to the buffet tables, I returned for one of the highlights of the meal: a made-to-order Indian crepe with mushroom cream filling and six hot toppings to spice it up. And for dessert? An eclair, some unusual ice cream, and an Indian sugarcane pastry  topped with a layer of edible silver foil. \n\nThe biggest treat of the evening was our walk of the grounds after dinner - through the Palace gardens and fountains, past the pool, and up to the roof for a spectacular view of the glowing City Palace reflected across the lake. \n\nWe ended our fairytale evening with the return boat trip back to land, where we returned back into reality and our $3 a night room.

It offers landscapes ranging from the Himalaya mountain range to the western Thar desert, plus the central plateau, plains, foothills, and islands. And of course, a billion people speaking 18 major languages and 1600 minor languages or dialects. \n\nMichelle and I are here for a short amount of time by Indian travel standards. I find myself apologizing that I am traveling through India for, \"...only four to six weeks.\" Only! Yet with only four to six weeks, we must confine our visit to a few states and major cities. \n\nOur first stop is the western state of Rajasthan - a desert land of old palaces, surly camels, sturdy forts, kaleidoscopic saris, sweet incense, twisting market roads, and of course - cows and trash in the street. \n\nRajasthan's only hill station is Mount Abu, a 1200-meter high plateau popular with domestic travelers and honeymooners for its cool climate and good views. We arrived this morning on a 13 hour night train from Bombay and received our first taste of honeymoon spirit on a shared jeep up the mountain, where two newlywed couples sat across from us holding hands and making eyes at each other. \n\nFrom its soft-serve ice cream parlors to fabric stores, Mount Abu is a tourist destination in full swing. But it is unlike the many destinations in India and southeast Asia that cater to western tastes. The vendors don't sell gaudy travel clothes and internet cafes don't take up half the retail space. And why not? Because Mount Abu is almost entirely a tourist destination for Indians. And as such, it is a great place to watch Indians out having fun.\n\nTonight we followed the evening crowds to the popular Sunset Point on the edge of the Mount Abu plateau. While we walked, others passed by us on out of control wagon-sized pushcarts. Few things can bring a smile to my face more quickly than watching several Indian women in bright saris being propelled at breakneck speeds up and down hills by a turban wearing men. Think Calvin and Hobbes in India.\n\nThe crowd watched the sunset while I watched the crowd. Most of the spectators were in playful moods and, compared to me in my grungy travel clothes, were surprisingly colorful and well dressed. As the sun set, camera toting photographers flashed photo albums and promised beautiful photos of newlyweds with the setting sun perched between them. Meanwhile, a young shoeless girl in a dirty orange dress tried unsuccessfully to sell chai from a stainless steel container that she skillfully balanced on her head. A few minutes later, another seller caught my eye with the color of her sari. Its brilliant red matched perfectly with the tomatoes she had for sale on a silver platter.\n\nMount Abu was a nice change from the culture of western tourists that we are so used to. I don't know if I'd come for my honeymoon, but I'm glad I had the chance to go."

In the center of town is a sacred Hindu lake, making the town an important Hindu pilgrimage center. It's fascinating to watch Hindu holy men walk around the narrow streets and hear the drums beat over the water as people celebrate holy festivals. \n\nGuesthouses and signs along the road post instructions to help foreigners behave correctly. Here is a sample of the rules: no alcohol, drugs, or non-vegetarian food allowed (this includes eggs); men and women must not embrace in public; shoes or slippers must not be worn at least 30 feet from the lake water. In Southeast Asia I was just getting a grasp of the Buddhist religion when we left. But I find myself painfully ignorant of the Hindu religion and customs. I have much learning to do and the signs are quite helpful; things quite natural for me to do at home could be highly offensive here. \n\nPushkar's streets are narrow and windy and are lined with temples, hotels, restaurants and stores displaying all kinds of touristry knick-knacks and souvenirs. Foreign visitors come here to wander, relax, and observe. \n\nJust sitting on a restaurant balcony watching the activity below offers a feast for the eyes: rich Indians in fancy shimmering suits and saris stroll by shops, buying beads and bangle bracelets. A tea seller (chai wallah) wearing a bright orange turban offers pedestrians hot milk tea in clay cups. The clay cups look like small flowerpots I might buy at home. These cups are disposable though - after buyers finish their drink, the cups are smashed on the ground! Chunks of broken pottery sit around the chai wallah's feet. Colorful carts full of vegetables or cooking ware roll by. Cows, goats, dogs and hogs walk around as if they own the streets.\n\nI find the old Indian men the most interesting characters to watch. Bright red turbans sit upon their heads, their leathery dark brown skin wrinkled and worn with character. White wisps of hair make-up their mustaches and beards, and beads dangle from their necks. Loose white cotton is tied around their bodies resembling huge diapers. \n\nPushkar attracts many hippies and they are almost as fascinating to watch as the Indians are. Dreadlocks, outfits from the 1960s, weird body piercing, and dazed looks parade by.  Some look like they came to India to get lost while others look like they have been lost for decades and need to be found! \n"

The once impressive Jaisalmer fort, with its golden stone walls, intricate details, and rich history, was now covered in the whimsical colors of Holi. My white clothes soon looked the same - with brilliant blotches of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Three adults blessed my face with three new colors and cheers of \"Happy Holi!\" Mobs of hyperactive kids in the street just blasted me with squirt guns full of colored water. \n\n<img src='/photos/in_holi2.jpg' width='275' height='139' align='right'>After passing through a gauntlet of colored festival-goers guarding the fort gates, I arrived to the market  and bought two packages gulal powder to throw back at people.  An Indian man called for me to follow him through the old part of town. I followed along with a British guy and the real fun began.\n\nThrough twisting narrow roads, outstretched palms grabbed my cheeks and spread silver paint across the several colors that already blessed my face. Similar hands spread additional layers of green, red, orange, and yellow. Two hand fulls of green powder thrown by a purple man blossom into a huge cloud that filled the street and rained down on top of us. Buckets of purple and red water rained down on my head. Water balloons burst on my back. Rambunctious children tried to stick gulal in my ears, nose, and eyes and steal my bag of powder. \n\n<img src='/photos/in_holi1.jpg' width='151' height='175' align='left'>The wash of water blended the dye, leaving every square inch of my skin and clothes a murky mess and making me look like a red grape. My face was visibly purple, silver, and green, although other colors would no doubt be seen a few layers down.  My matted red hair was shellacked to my head, my teeth were green, and my ears and nose were full of powder.  And I would do it all again if given the choice.\n\nI will be back home on the next full moon of March, so don't be surprised to be hit with a bag of red powder and an enthusiastic greeting.  \n\n\"Happy Holi!\""

Seemingly oblivious to its awkward location, it chews nonchalantly as motorcycles, cars, rickshaws, and bicycles whiz past with only inches to spare. A truck driver turns his steering wheel wildly to avoid collision, barely missing a rickshaw. But no one honks or looks annoyed. The cow is a natural element is this city scene û like a rock in a fast flowing stream of water.\n\n<img src='/photos/in_cow.jpg' width='275' height='186' align='right'>A symbol of mother, fertility, and nurturing, cows are considered sacred animals in India. Beef is not eaten, leather is not worn, and in almost all of the country it is illegal to kill them. Cows wander freely in the streets until they are ready to be milked. They sit in groups along the road, stand defiantly in the middle of the street, cruise alleys, and hang in front of store windows. When a cow is ready to be milked, the owner brings it back to their house. Many of the cow horns are painted in bright colors, making it easy for the owner to distinguish it from others.\n\nJust in my short stay here, I see the cows usefulness to Indian society. The cows and bulls are used to pull heavy loads on carts and work the fields; milk is used for curd and butter, in the villages dried cow dung is used in fires for cooking or mixed with mud to build walls. The cows also serve as good garbage disposals, eating much of the litter piled high on the streets.\n\nI love cows. I developed a special fondness for this creature when I attended college in rural Virginia, surrounded by farmland. Who can resist their large brown eyes, black and white patches, pink udders, and gentle moos? As an artist I am charmed by their shape, their silhouettes in the landscape. \n\nIndian cows seem to know the gods have shined special favor on their lot. They roam around the city streets with a confident smugness, making trucks and buses ten times their size go around them. I might not fully understand the concept of worshipping cows, but I do know this: India would not be the same without cows on the streets. They add charm and extra spice to an already chaotic and vibrant scene.\n"

Our destination though was the nearby town of Pushkar, which meant catching another bus in Ajmer's city center a couple kilometers away. The only sign of life on the road was a line of rickshaws waiting for passengers.\n\nI knew it would be an interesting time when the drivers ran to the approaching bus door, pushing and shoving each other for a better position to snag a customer. As we descended into the yelling, waving, pushing group we donned our \"don't mess with us\" faces and prepared to bargain hard. Very quickly all the local Indian passengers on the bus seemed to disappear and we were left standing with two English guys (the only other foreigners on the bus) and about 20 aggressive rickshaw drivers.\n\nImmediately one driver, who seemed to be the leader of the pack, announced the fare would be 40 rupees. By his insistence to hurry to his rickshaw and lack of eye contact we were certain he was charging us way too much. But to be honest, we had no idea where we were or how far it was to the other bus. We hemmed and hawed not wanting to be overcharged for being ignorant foreigners. It was then I noticed a minibus containing all the Indian bus passengers. So this is where they had disappeared to. One of the British guys asked the driver if his bus was going to the bus station in town. Indeed it was. How much? Four rupees!\n\nSo we all gathered our packs and walked to the minibus amidst a shower of protests from the rickshaw drivers. They yelled things like, \"You are not allowed on that bus!\" or \"It's not going to where you want to go!\" When we looked undeterred they created a human wall and blocked our entrance onto the minibus, demanding the driver leave. We watched helplessly as our cheap, convenient option drove away.\n\nWe thought about walking but not knowing where we needed to go and night was falling, we just had to play along with these bullying rickshaw drivers. The British guys managed to talk a driver into a 20 rupee ride, jumped into the rickshaw and were gone.\n\nNow Tim and I had to fend for ourselves. The leader told us we would never get the same fare. I stood back and watched Tim argue. Standing on the sidelines, I felt a poke in my ribs. A pudgy flirtatious rickshaw driver smiled and whispered he would take us for 20 rupees. I told Tim, who then pointed his finger at our new friend and declared defiantly to the whole group, \"He will take us for 20 rupees!\" A tornado of activity errupted around us. Fists flew up in the air as the other rickshaw drivers yelled at the dissenter. The scene looked like a disturbed hornet's nest. I think the helpful driver had broken some code of rickshaw ethics and overstepped some invisible boundary. Who knows.\n\nWhen we hauled our packs into the rickshaw, another rickshaw was pulled up in front of it, blocking our exit. By this point we were laughing. The whole ordeal had become comical.  I told the drivers I didn't care who took us, but we wouldn't go for more than 20 rupees. Our bags were transferred to another rickshaw and we were finally allowed to leave. As we pulled away we waved in relief and the mob of drivers waved back. It looked like a warped version of a sentimental farewell send-off.  The ride to the other bus was uneventful and I was thankful we hadn't tried to walk. \n\nTim handed the 20 rupee note to our driver when we arrived at the other bus. The driver said, \"No, the fare is twenty rupees for each of you.\" But there was a twinkle in his eyes and we all laughed.\n\nIt was a hard won fight - all over about 50 US cents!"

The temperature was getting noticeably cooler as we climbed higher and I reached for my jacket. The bus rounded a bend and revealed white peaks jutting into the sky, keeping company with the clouds. Tim and I grinned broadly at our first glimpse of the Himalayan Mountain peaks. The bus continued to climb as the sun set and soon the mountains glowed bright pink until darkness blanketed the land.\n\nOur destination was Dharamsala, home of the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet and the Tibetan exiled government. The Dalai Lami is giving public teaching in the temple for two weeks and therefore the town is packed full of red-robed monks and foreigners seeking spiritual enlightenment. Arriving at 10 PM, we found the hotels full but eventually found a room in a small village 2 km away. From the moment we arrived I noticed the town has a different feel from the rest of India. The Buddhist influence and gentle Tibetan community make it an easy, laid-back place to hang out.\n\nThe Chinese invaded Tibet in 1949 claiming it to be a part of their country and in 1959\tthe Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government were forced into exile into India. Now they reside in Upper Dharmasala, (called McLeod Ganj). The Tibetan community here is very strong and their on-going struggle against the Chinese is evident. Posters line the street with slogans such as \"Free Tibet\" and \"Boycott Chinese Goods.\" Over 1000 refugees are still coming out of Tibet each year, fleeing from the violence and their stories are moving and tragic. The Dalai Lama, a gentle man with a huge smile, still hopes to return his people to their homeland. He is a committed to non-violence and compassion towards the Chinese; so much so that in 1989 he won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe community atmosphere here is very strong. There are many organizations set up to help the refugees - an orphanage for the children, medical clinics, cafes sponsoring speakers, a center for former political prisoners, and many opportunities to volunteer. It is a special opportunity to visit a community where people work together for peace and healing with a common purpose - freeing Tibet and saving its culture."

Besides serving food, the cafe serves the Tibetan freedom cause by publishing a monthly newsletter, acting as an information center, employing recently arrived refugees, and sponsoring lectures every Sunday night.\n\nIt was here in a crowded house that we saw the 70 year-old Tibetan monk Palden Gyatso speak about his 33 year experience as a political prisoner in a Chinese jail. Through the aid of a translator, the saffron-robed grandfatherly man talked about the history of Tibet and told a moving story from his start in a small village to his incarceration and torture by the Chinese. His remarkably gentle face surprisingly betrays no bitterness or anger towards his captors despite the hardships they put him through - he watched helplessly as many of his fellow prisoners died of thirst and malnutrition and was frequently tortured with a cattle prod. In one particularly harsh story, he detailed how his Chinese jailers forced a cattle prod in his mouth, breaking two teeth in the process and shocking him unconscious to the ground. The rest of his teeth fell out within a month.\n\nBut his story has a happy ending. Through the help of <a href='http://www.amnesty.org/'>Amnesty International</a>, the Chinese released Palden Gyatso and he fled here to Dharamsala. He detailed his story in the book <i><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Autobiography-Tibetan-Monk-Palden-Gyatso/dp/0802135749/ref=sr_1_2'>Fire Under the Snow</a> </i>and has since lectured at 87 schools and universities and has been interviewed by CNN and the BBC. And in the most shining example of his change of fortune, <a href='http://www.amnesty.org/'>Amnesty International</a> provided him with a new set of teeth, which he happily took out to show the audience."

From here I can see the taxi stand, bus station, and people greeting each other while others hurry by. Directly below me is a row of lepers begging on a ledge, their backs leaning against the window. The two women and man chat, pausing only to ask for money as people pass. \n\nAll that remains of their fingers are stubs and their feet are bandaged and unwhole. The oldest woman is also missing her nose. These beggars have become a familiar sight during my stay in Dharamsala. They usually camp out on this ledge and I pass them several times a day. But the sight of the fingerless hands extending towards me made me uncomfortable and I would walk quickly by. But today I watch them undetected and the longer I watch, the more involved I become in their world.\n\nI observe who they target as they beg - foreigners get the most pleas and animated gestures, monks are ignored, and it is give and take with the locals. I also watch the responses of the pedestrians. Some people hurry by, others quicken their steps careful not to look at the beggars, while others smile and say hello. A young woman stops and offers her crackers. I found myself secretly cheering when money was deposited in their tin buckets. Once in a while someone would stop and talk to the lepers and I would witness laughter, smiles and beautiful human interactions.\n\nI watch as one of the women takes a 10 rupee note from the donations, fumbles with her bags, stuggling to grasp the handles with her stubs. She rises to walk to a nearby vegetable seller and buys potatoes and onions, no doubt for a meal later.  I wonder about her daily life and how she copes each day as her body deteriorates. The longer I watch, the more compassion grows in my heart. The row of lepers ceases to be just beggars wanting something from me, but individuals trying to survive.\n\nAs I leave the cafe I make a point to give them each some money, a smile, and a blessing. By sitting and watching them my heart has grown a little bigger and I am thankful for that gift.\n"

We spent a couple of days there as well, soaking in the scene and listening to the English translation through an FM radio.\n\nSince I am not here specifically for the teachings, I tended to be far less concentrated than the average attendee and found myself laughing at the monkeys playing in the trees, gazing at a storm brewing over the mountain vista, or watching the eagles circling in thermals above the pine trees. The temple is an attractive place to learn and I envied those who took to the time to listen to all two weeks of sessions. \n\nSo many people had traveled so far to listen to this one person, a leader famous for his compassion and positive attitude.

A careless step could land your foot squarely in a fresh steaming cow pie or black sludge of a sewer gutter.  A wrongly angled foot, knee, or elbow is in danger of being smashed by a vehicle flying by.\n\n<img src='/photos/in_cows.jpg' width='275' height='185' align='right'>Cows, which dot the streets, add special pizzazz to any stroll. They might look innocent but they actually offer several hazards. It is wise to keep your eyes on them as you pass. A rising tail is an important sign to hurry by. When a cow rids itself of excrement many times it shoots out like a cannon. If you are in the line of fire it could be a smelly, nasty mess. Equally important is to watch the head and horns, as some cows have unpleasant dispositions and sharp horns. A couple of days ago I was standing in a narrow alley in Jaisalmer when I was pushed hard from behind. Shocked, I turned to find a cow's lowered head and horns pointing at my chest. It kept bumping me hard, pushing me farther and farther into the dead-end alley. (Luckily the distance between the horns was so wide that they framed me on each side and missed me entirely.)  I was alarmed and felt trapped. Locals sitting on roofs above peered down, laughing and pointing at my predicament. Finally, a man with a stick came to my rescue by pushing the cow to one side, leaving just enough room for me to squeeze by. It was a close call.\n\nTo successfully complete the obstacle course, you must watch your stamina. The constant barrage from rickshaw drivers, shopkeepers, and touts can be draining. The easiest solution is to hide in your hotel, which becomes an oasis from the hassles. But locked in a hotel room you won't see India!  Therefore, a positive attitude is essential - smile at shopkeepers, joke with the rickshaw drivers, and ignore the touts (who lie, misdirect and cheat). Remaining calm and positive keeps your dignity and your energy.\n\nIndia is two thirds the size of the US but its population is over one billion - lots of people, lots of poverty. Beggars add a whole other element to the scene. Children with large eyes tugging persistently at your sleeve, mothers pointing at babies in their arms, lepers without limbs, deformed men on wheeled carts, old women pleading for a rupee confront you when you step out into the street. It is emotionally draining to see all this human suffering and it's a struggle to know how to help. I know plopping down a few coins doesn't really alleviate the problem and it's impossible to help everyone who asks. I don't give any money to children beggars because I was told many times parents keep their children out of school deliberately so they can beg instead. I don't want to encourage this practice.  I fight guilt knowing I can afford a trip around the world and yet many of these people can barely afford to eat. There are no easy answers.\n\nIf you finish your walk unscathed, you can breathe a sigh of relief. It is not easy to be flung into so much commotion, to be the target of unwanted attention, and to constantly keep your guard up. But if you can successfully avoid the obstacles, you will be richly rewarded with new sights, sounds, and experiences. India is a place like no other."

High on a hill towers a huge fort, dominating the city landscape. Built in 1156 for protection against invaders, it now houses a busy city life including hotels, shops, and restaurants for tourists. Contained within its massive walls are giant gates, a maze of narrow lanes and alleys, small courtyards littered with cows and sleeping dogs, and a magical palace whose sandstone walls are covered in intricate carvings.\n\nIt is five in the evening and I am sitting on our hotel roof high above the city, across from the palace. I am alone except for the company of gray pigeons, singing sparrows, and the whispering dry hot wind. Everything is the color of yellow sand - the ground, the walls, the buildings, and the roads. From this height I can see far into the distance where civilization ends and only stark desert terrain remains. \n\nDirectly below me is the massive fort wall and then a steep rocky slope. A family of pigs makes its way down the slope as a dog chases and teases the piglet, who squeals in protest. A woman balances a water jug on her head as she passes on the road below. A cow lumbers down the road.\n\n<img src='/photos/in_jaisalmer.jpg' width='250' height='198' align='left'>It is easy to see the desert houses from this height. They are simple square structures with courtyards in their center. A woman sits on the ground in her courtyard with a child in her lap. They both wave as they see me peering down on them. Large clay pots for storing water surround them and wash is laid out on the house roof to dry.\n\nAs the sun sinks lower, I watch the hues of honey yellow change. I relish the solitude and quiet up here. The lone voice of a man singing Muslim evening prayers begins and floats up to me. His voice is melancholy, slow, and soothing -  reflective of my mood."

Flight 309 offers me a small introduction to what's ahead - the stewardesses wear saris, Indian curry is served for dinner, the in-flight movie is in Hindi, and the man sitting in the next seat wears a turban and a bushy black beard.\n\nIn the next four weeks I will learn much.\n"

We arrived in Nepal a couple of days ago and are still overwhelmed at the friendliness of the people. We've had little time to sight see though because our days have been full running errands and preparing for our next adventure. Tomorrow, joined by two friends we met in Thailand, we take a plane and helicopter to Lulka, a small village nestled in the Himalayan Mountains in the Kimbu region of Nepal. There, we will begin a three week trek to the Mt. Everest Base Camp as well as other surrounding trails.\n\nSpring is coming to Kathmandu - flowers are blooming, fruit hangs on trees, and during the day the temperature reaches 70 degrees. But we are heading into some of the highest mountains in the world. Trekking at heights over 18,000 feet, where sudden snow storms and extremely cold nights are the norm, we have to be prepared for these conditions. So we have rented -20 degree sleeping bags and down jackets, and bought gloves, scarves, thermal underwear, and camping gear. Trekking is the number one activity of visiting tourists and Kathmandu's streets are lined with plenty of shops selling gear. We will be sleeping and eating in basic lodges and teahouses along the trails, so thankfully we won't have to carry much food and water or tents.\n\nSo we apologize for our site being quiet for the rest of the month. Picture us high up in the mountains, trekking among beautiful lakes and mountain peaks, in view of the highest mountains in the world. When we return we will be sure to update the site with stories and photos of our time with Mt. Everest!"

But there we were, dressed as suckers, wearing backpacks and lost expressions while searching for guidance from a Lonely Planet map.\n\nWith a fair way to walk, our journey turned into quite a game. Here were the rules:\n\n<ol><li>Our object was to buy tickets at the New Delhi Railway Station's Tourist Booking Office.</li>\n<li>The object of the touts was to misdirect us to private tour companies, who would then lie to us about the availability of rail tickets and offer their bus tickets or tours as an alternative.</li>\n<li>These private tour companies were always labeled as being \"Official Government Tourist Offices\".</li>\n<li>Touts would say ANYTHING to get you to come with them, as in:</li>\n<li>I am a student and here to help.

Our journey was like a real life logic puzzle:\n\n<b>IF</b>  100% of the people in Delhi who offer unsolicited help lie...\n<b>BUT</b>  75% of the people whom YOU ask for help tell the truth to the best of their knowledge...\n<b>HOWEVER</b>  50% of the people who try to answer truthfully do not know the answer, but make it up to avoid looking foolish...\n<b>HOW</b> many wrong turns will you make walking to the Tourist Booking Office?  \n\nIt didn't take long before we ignored the tout's constant advances and stopped listening. Even walking up to the second floor office, under a big sign labeled Tourist Booking Office with an arrow pointing up the stairs, someone pointed us into an incorrect office.  I couldn't believe their lies - one after the other and all with a straight face.  It was comical to a degree unmatched in 10 months of travel.\n\n"

I'm unable to sleep and my body is simultaneously shivering and sweating. \n\nOutside my room, thousands of people celebrate the Hindi New Year down by the bank of the holy Ganges River. The uproar floating in through my window speaks of a world very foreign to mine, as festival goers ring bells, toot horns, bang drums, play exotic musical instruments, and chant. Ash smeared Hindus cleanse themselves in the polluted river. A fog of incense smoke covers the large crowd as they celebrate riverside all night long. \n\nAt 4 AM the festival continues. Five, six, the sun comes up and I've just slept in catnaps. I've got a fever over 103 degrees, I'm restless, and waves of nausea hit me like a brick when I move. I sit up too quickly and soon find myself thanking Michelle for placing the trash can bedside.  I feel like a human geyser with liquids shooting out both ends. \n\nIt is times like this when I feel the most alienated from home. We move to a more expensive room that has a TV and cable, but even taking solace in mindless programming is impossible. Fred Flintstone and Scooby Doo are on the Cartoon Network, but they speak Hindi along with the rest of the translated programs on the Discovery Channel. \n\nOutside in the guesthouse courtyard the Hindi music is screeching. I yearn for the clean sober feeling of health and pray that I'm well enough to leave on our flight to Kathmandu in 36 hours."

Or four cases of Coke, three 12 kg packages of creamer, and some other heavy miscellaneous items. \n\nEverything here is carried by hand - from the bottled water, to the glass windows in lodges and occasional washer/dryer. \n\nToday we saw the most magnificent example, a 95-kg (209-lb.) television in the Tengboche Monastery's visitor's center.   Surely, I asked the staff, this mammoth thing was airlifted up by helicopter? But no, not only was this carried by hand from a small bush airstrip half a day away, it was carried down 650 meters (2,132 ft) and back up 616 meters (2,001 ft). And the load was fought over because the porters were paid 7 rupees per kilo. I had to do the math. For all of his effort, the porter was paid about $9 US!\n\nAnd you thought your job was hard."

It can cause symptoms ranging from the simple: headaches, sleeplessness, shortness of breath, nausea, and dizziness, to the very serious: vomiting, loss of coordination, cerebral edema, pulmonary edema, and even death. It is a very dangerous problem in the altitudes that we were trekking in and something that we had to take very seriously.\n\nIncreased urination is a minor symptom, but one that has caused me the most danger so far. Thanks to AMS, I really needed to use our lodge's outhouse. But standing in between urgent release and me, stood a huge furry black yak with a white spot on his chest and rather large menacing horns. He stood his ground firmly, blocking the threshold of a stone wall that I needed to cross. \n\n<img src='/photos/np_yak.jpg' width='250' height='202' align='right'>He eyes stared at me sideways and spoke clearly. It was clear he wasn't going to move without a fight. I yelled like a Sherpa, \"Heh! Yah!\" I waved my hands and jumped up and down. He turned his head a few degrees and said that if I didn't stop this nonsense soon, I'd see the business end of his horns.\n\nJust as I was about to flee, a burley Tibetan looking woman ambled over, bent down, and scooped a handful of stones from the ground. Suddenly the yak didn't seem so tough. She hurled a couple of stones over his back and he went running like his tail was on fire.\n\nAnd thus, I was saved from dire consequences of AMS."

We have gradually acclimatized from Kathmandu's 1,400 meters (4\t595 ft.) to Gorek Shep's 5,170 meters (16,962 ft.), met lots of good friends in lodges along the way, and walked through amazing scenery.\n\nBut today we faced the destination of our journey: the 5,600-meter (18,373-ft.) peak of Kala Pattar. A mountain that, though it requires no guides or climbing experience, could offer us a beautiful view of Mount Everest and its surrounding ranges and take us higher in altitude than we have ever been before. (Pictured here as the smaller of two peaks, next to Pumori at 7,145 m.)\n\nWhen we started up towards the peak early in the morning, a cloud line hung above 5,400 meters and blocked the view from the top. Many trekkers considered the climb worthless and descended to wait for fair weather. We just remained optimistic and kept moving up the snow-covered trail.\n\n\n<img src='/photos/np_sunrise.jpg' width='275' height='186' align='left'>The track rose up the mountain gradually, but at 5\t500 meters the air pressure was 50% that of sea level and we struggled just to inhale enough oxygen to keep moving. After 12 days of walking up hills I felt great, and yet I still stopped, gasping for air every few minutes to catch my breath. \n\nWe rose slowly up the mountain, scrambled up the final rock pile to the very top and arrived to 5,600 meters and a great view of... clouds! \n\nNo big surprise - after all, we were walking in fog. But in the space of five minutes, the clouds lifted up out of view like a curtain on our mountain stage. Suddenly we were surrounded by 360 degrees of the world's largest mountains: Nuptse at 7,861 m, Lhotse at 8,501 m, several peaks over 6,500 m, and of course the king of all - Everest at 8,850. Below it all ran the Khumbu Glacier, sweeping miles of rock and ice down towards the lowlands at a rate of four inches per day.\n\nI sat thunderstruck and felt a genuine sense of joy. The immensity of these surroundings humbled me in a way that is indescribable, like standing on a cliff overlooking the Grand Canyon, but without the roads, phones, cars, and help nearby.  I'd walked 12 days to get here, dealt with diarrhea and sleeping in the cold. I'd cast off the warm sense of security from my life at home. And now I felt fully alive on top of the world.\n\nThis is what my year is all about - learning to live life as fully as possible."

Instead, I long for nightfall, so I can sleep and start over tomorrow with renewed energy.\n\nWe have finished out two week trek to the Everest Base Camp and today began the Gokyo trek û up into the high mountains along a mountain valley to see glacier lakes and different views of Everest.

Taking off our shoes at the temple entrance we enter silently and sit on Tibetan rugs against the wall. In the center of the room five monks sit on benches, wrapped in red wool robes, chanting in a low melodic murmur. Every morning and afternoon they gather here to chant mantras - Buddha's words of compassion, peace, and well being.\n\nAs their chants swirl around me I look around the ornate temple room. Colorfully painted murals decorate the walls and a large gilded gold Buddha sits at the front, observing and smiling over the proceedings. The monks deep voices pause for a tea break as another monk scurries in with a large tea pot. Each monk holds their cup with both hands, white steam enveloping their heads as they sip noisily.\n\nWhen the chanting begins again instruments are introduced. Horns, drums, and cymbals accompany the swaying monks, adding a distinctly oriental sound. Local sherpas enter the temple and a man falls prostrate in front of the monks and Buddha. He rises and falls many times, a ritual to receive blessing.\n\nThe sun hits the mountain outside and brilliant white streams into the dark room, making me squint. My feet are numb from the cold and sitting so long but I feel I could sit here for hours. Even though I can't understand the Tibetan chants, I am filled with peace. Watching the monks practice their own spirituality brings my own spiritual life into clearer focus and I feel closer to God. My soul is quiet and at peace. It is a great way to start the day.\n"

It might be because the air is so clean and unpolluted that the colors are more vivid. I am more convinced though, the truth lies in the eye of the beholder.

      "text": "<img src='/photos/in_camelmich.jpg' width='126' height='200' align='right'>I learned something new over the last two days: camels are very smelly creatures. However, I could not tell you which smells worse, their breath or their farts. For the last two days Tim and I have been on a camel trek in the Thar Desert, on the borders of Pakistan and India. During much of this time my nose has been in an unattractive wrinkled position, trying to avoid a sick, hot grassy odor. At first, I thought the camel in front of mine had a terrible gas problem (I often heard little toots coming from his rear area), but with time I realized the culprit was my own camel. Out of his pouty lips poured green grassy foam and grumpy grunts producing the foul smell. This was my first prolonged contact with camels and despite their offensive smell, I quickly grew endeared to these creatures and their surly ways. \n\nWe started our trek in the morning after an hour jeep ride into a small desert village. Camels and guides were waiting for us there. Village women passed balancing large clay pots on their heads as they headed to the communal well, children gathered around us asking for candy, and a small goat sniffed my backpack, also looking for goodies. A Japanese couple and their daughter joined the group and we began our adventure. Our caravan consisted of five tourists, six guides, and nine camels. \n\nPerched high on the camel's back, I sat on a saddle loaded with blankets to protect my bum. I held a rope, attached to pegs sticking out of the camel's nose, to help direct the creature. Pulling on the ropes was supposed to steer him the right direction. I was also supposed to kick my heels into the camel's sides to prod it to start walking or increase speed, but he blatantly ignored me until a guide would nudge him from behind. So much for showing who was boss!\n\nOn the surface, the desert appeared a dry, hot lifeless terrain. But as our caravan processed through the stark land, we met many of its inhabitants. Peacocks, the national bird of India, took flight from the shrubs into surrounding trees as we passed, their blue and green tails lighting up the sky in a startling color. Goats and sheep would pause in their hunt for food to curiously watch us. Everything was so dry and dead and I wondered what they possibly ate, but they looked healthy and well fed. In the distance, a huge black vulture sat alone, warily watching our party.\n\n<img src='/photos/in_camelsun.jpg' width='250' height='162' align='left'>A dog joined us as we left the village and remained close by throughout the entire trek. He had a peculiar look, for in its past, someone had cruelly cut off his ears. Besides being ear-less, he was terribly skinny, with his rib cage protruding out, and had a long, pink tongue that hung so low it almost touched the ground. When I grew bored with the monotonous desert landscape I would watch the dog's antics for entertainment. He would weave in and out of the camel's legs with ease, chase birds and other small creatures. Once he appeared with two white legs sticking out of his mouth - a lizard lunch.\n\n<img src='/photos/in_camelman.jpg' width='114' height='200' align='right'>Around lunchtime, when the sun was the hottest, we dismounted and I could feel the hot sand burning through my sandals. We settled on blankets under a large tree as the guides immediately set to work making lunch. One dug a hole in the sand and started a fire. Another man chopped vegetables and another kneaded dough to make chapatis - a familiar staple of thin bread cooked on a hot plate. The smallest guide, a ten-year old boy, main job was to chase the camels that grew restless and wandered off. Camels are surprisingly quick and the boy worked hard. For the next couple of hours we rested, read, and ate a tasty lunch of cauliflower potato curry, bread, and fruit. A hot dry air blew and in the distance we watched small air funnels (small tornadoes) emerge suddenly and whip tumbleweed and sand high into the air. \n\n<img src='/photos/in_desert.jpg' width='200' height='127' align='left'>The heat eventually softened as the afternoon progressed and we set off once again. Soon, beautifully wind-sculpted sand dunes emerged from the flat land. Here we stopped to set up camp. While our guides fed the camels and made dinner, we kicked off our shoes and explored, letting the fine grain sand sink softly between our toes. We jumped down the steep slopes like little children and walked along the ridges, marveling at the simple beauty of sand and sky. In some places we found white sea shells, evidence that once this desert had been under water. \n\nWhen the sun sank low, we climbed to the highest ridge to watch it set. Later we climbed the ridge again to watch the full moon rise. After dinner and time around a bonfire we fell asleep on blankets, bathed in moonlight and sprinkled in star light.\n"

Boulders, silt and snow decorate the huge glacier in the valley. From this height the village of Gokyo seems so far away - our lodge is just a tiny speck and the herd of yaks living in the adjoining field is undetectable.  Mountain ranges fill the horizon: Nuptse, Cholatae, Kangchung, Makalu, and the most famous, Everest. I think of all the people who have died trying to climb to its top and the sacrifices and risks people take to fulfill their dreams.\n\n<img src='/photos/np_thirdlake.jpg' width='250' height='171' align='right'>Others who had also risen at dawn to climb the peak sit on rocks, taking in the views, snapping pictures, and resting. Black ravens perch on rocks nearby hoping for crumbs from trekkers eating biscuits. I had seen animal tracks in the snow as I ascended up the trail. I let my imagination run and imagined a snow leopard prowling on the peak. Reaching the top, I was disappointed to realise it was only the prints of a dog, who now lay exhausted in the snow. I recognised the dog from the day before where in the village I had watched him bark and nip playfully at the yaks.  I stoop down, pet him, and offer him some peanuts which he gratefully accepts.\n\nI start to descend as the sun gets higher. People bound past me, hurrying down. But I descend slowly. For one reason, the snow is melting and the trail is slippery. But I also go slowly because I want to stop every few moments to absorb the view. This will be the last peak I climb on this trek and I don't know when I will ever see views like this again.\n\nAt one point I pause to watch an eagle soar above in the sky. Its mighty wings spread, it circles round and round. I marvel at its freedom. Another trekker, a young woman, stops next to me to also watch. We say nothing, just look up and smile, sharing in the sacredness of the moment. After a while, the eagle flies away, lost in the vivid blue sky and I continue on. I wonder how many things I've missed in life because I was in a hurry or too busy to look around. I vow when I return home to try to live a quieter, simpler life - one where I take time to look up.\n"

Some were there because their parents worked at stalls, selling goods to tourists, and others were there working as tour guides. I questioned one 11-year-old boy why he wasn't in school and he explained he attends school in the morning and then gives tours in the afternoon. He is not supposed to work on the temple grounds so a large part of the money he earns goes to police as a payoff. I didn't hire him myself, but watched as he led a large group of American tourists through stone ruins. Facts and dates flowed from his lips and I found him articulate, funny, and bright. There is not a lot of opportunities for a poor village boy in Cambodia, but I hope this kid is successful in life.

      "text": "We started our hike to Everest Base Camp under low hanging gray clouds and fast dropping temperatures. The threat of snow was obvious but we were anxious to see Base Camp. After all, we had hiked nine days to get this far.\n\nWe walked for a couple hours along a glacier stream, among huge gray boulders and on a thin path along a mountain ridge. A glacier sat below and  mountain peaks towered above us. From here we could just see Everest Base Camp, the tents distant colored dots.\n\nOur group climbed down the steep ridge, amidst a sea of rocks and began our hike on the Kumbu Glacier. I didn't really realize I was walking on a glacier until I looked down and saw a huge crevasse along the side of the trail. Peering inside there seemed to be no bottom, only darkness. I joked that jumping in would be the fast and cheap way to return home, on the other side of the world. But I also made a serious mental note to watch my steps more carefully. The stark terrain made me feel like I was on another planet. Large boulders, the size of small cars, balanced precariously on small nuggets of ice. Impressive ice forms jutted out along the way, at times looking like an ice forest. \n\nA thunderous sound echoed and we stopped to watch an avalanche cascade down the nearby ice fall. The resulting roar and displaced snow reminded us of nature's power. It was then I saw a  line of small dots on the left side of the giant ice fall - Everest climbers practicing for their climb to the summit. I couldn't imagine what they were thinking at that moment, being so close to the avalanche. Later, a sherpa told me many sherpa climbers had died there due to the instability of the ice. \n\nMid-afternoon we arrived at Base Camp (17,600 ft). It was a colorful \"tent city\" in a landscape of rock. The first group of tents to greet us belonged to the Korean expedition, their flags waving in the wind. I peeked in their dining tent and saw people eating lunch. I wondered what it was like to live in this cold world of rock and ice for weeks on end.\n\nBase Camp is especially busy this year with 14 expedition teams. It is not a cheap undertaking to organize an expedition. Nepal charges $70,000 per seven member team and  an additional $10,000 for each additional climber. Add the cost of equipment, supplies, and hiring sherpas and porters, and it equals a small fortune.\n\nOne team had a satellite dish and I assumed that was the American group. I had heard there was a morning news show there to document and televise the American climbers. Porters had carried the satallite dish in in small pieces. Tibetan prayer flags fluttered in the wind, no doubt, sending up protection prayers to the heavens for the climbers.\n\nThe clouds became more thick and menacing and we could see the snow falling in the distance. Relunctantly, we decided to head back to our lodge. Halfway home it started snowing and made the world a winter wonderland. It was a perfect ending to an exciting day."

I wanted to see the Hindu pilgrims bathing in the river, washing away their sins and making offerings. As we slowly glided down the river, I stared in fascination at the busy bank. The ghats were alive with activity. \n\nI watched as men and women stripped to almost nothing and plunged into the water. Children splashed and swam as a woman stood over them, lifting her hands to the heavens, her lips moving in silent prayer. People washed their clothes, pet dogs, and children in the holy water - a baby screamed in protest as a mother scrubbed her naked body, soap suds flying like electric sparks. Orange marigold petals floated by the boat, the remains of an offering. It was intriguing to witness the sacredness of a river and the people who worshipped its waters. \n\n<img src='/photos/in_bathers.jpg' width='275' height='151' align='left'>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

We are excited to eat Greek food (feta cheese, olive oil, kalamari...), to see the Parthenon and other ancient ruins, and to island hop, basking in the Mediterranean sun. Tim's good friends, Bill and Cecilia, are getting married on the Greek isle of Santorini on May 20th, and we are thrilled to join them for the celebration.\n\nA few days ago we started our eleventh month of travel. Leaving Asia and entering the West once again is evidence we are slowly making our way home. My emotions are mixed as our trip is drawing nearer to completion. I long to see family and friends but will miss the constant adventure and growth that travel gives.\n\n5 p.m.: Now we are sitting at an outdoor cafe, eating kalamari and drinking beer under the shadow of the Acropolis. It is amazing how an airplane flight can transport you to another world in a matter of hours. We spent the afternoon walking around Plaka, the old city of Athens, next to the Acropolis. Souvenir shops line the narrow streets selling leather goods, reproductions of ancient Greek art, T-shirts, postcards, and other touristy paraphernalia. People sip coffee in outdoor cafes, flowers decorate balconies, and dogs sleep in the sun. I am overwhelmed at the striking difference from Asia. Gone is the land of Buddha, Hindu gods, and temples. Now we are in the land of Greek gods and Christian churches. Gone are the trash lined streets, shoddy constructed buildings, and beggars. Instead, we are surrounded by spotless streets, renovated buildings, and chic stylishly dressed city-dwellers. The prices are different too. The cost of a cup of coffee here is the same amount we paid for a decent hotel room in Kathmandu. It depresses a budget traveler! I predict a lot more self-catered meals, dorm rooms, and much less shopping!"

We are \"teahouse trekking\" and ironically enough, we are in relative comfort while the others freeze because we chose the less expensive option. The people outside have paid thousands of dollars for guides to guide, cooks to cook, and teams of porters to carry tents (dining, sleeping, and toilet), tables, stoves, food, and gear. \n\nAs independent travelers, we sleep and eat in the many stone lodges along the way. They are simple, yet cozy and comfortable. We have even hired two porters to split between five people, at only $9 per porter per day. So as I sit here in my $1.50 a night room and sleep on a real mattress, I wonder why anyone would pay thousands for a 21 day trek when one can be more comfortable paying only the $300 that it will cost me."

      "text": "Royal Chitwan National Park lies close to the border of India, in a subtropical plain. Home to rhinoceros, tigers, sloth bears, monkeys, deer, and over 450 types of birds, it is a superb place to view wildlife. On our first morning visiting the park we decided to take a canoe ride into the park and from there, walk through the jungle on a guided trek. Walking through the jungle is not particularly safe, but it is the most exciting way to see the wildlife up close.\n\nFloating down the river in a dug-out canoe offered a front row seat to the bird life: white egrets stood gracefully on the water's edge, a huge stork (the largest I have ever seen) stood in a small cove eating in seclusion, a rust colored duck dunked happily, kingfishers sang along the shore while sandpipers peered out of their nests, holes in the sandy river bank. The variety and multitude of birds was amazing.\n\nForty minutes down stream the canoe hit the shore with a thud and our two guides jumped out. Immediately they both started jumping up and down in frantic motions - I thought is must be a strange Nepalese ritual dance asking the gods for protection before entering the jungle. But then I understood their funny movements when I saw a snake slithering between their unprotected flip-flopped feet and escaping into the river. Welcome to the jungle.\n\nWe walked across a sandy area and entered woods. The guides stopped to give us brief \"survival\" lessons:\n\n<b>Lesson 1:</b> Rhinos have terrible eyesight but have keen senses of smell and hearing. Their bad eyesight makes them vulnerable so they compensate by charging when they sense danger. So upon sighting a rhino, climb the nearest tree, scaling at least eight feet off the ground. If there are no trees, throw your backpack to the ground to cause a distraction and then run in a zigzag line (rhinos have a hard time turning their large bodies quickly). As if that wasn't enough to make me cautious, the guide informed us it was rhino mating season and the male rhinos are much more aggressive than usual. In fact, a Nepalese student had been killed the previous month by a charging rhino. \n\n<b>Lesson 2:</b>  Sloth bears can be extremely aggressive. When encountering a sloth bear gather in a close group and start yelling and waving your arms, pretending to be one large foe. Both our guides carried large intimidating sticks to defend the group in case of an attack. Later, they admitted of all the animals in the park, they most feared the bear.\n\n<b>Lesson 3:</b>  Tigers hunt by night and would be a rare sight. If one did attack, there is not much we could do about it, so try not to worry. Very comforting.\n\nNone of these lessons made me feel particularly good about our walk but now there was no turning back. We were in the heart of the jungle, far from any roads. Lessons over, we began our trek. Every tree I passed I wondered if I could climb. As a kid I climbed many trees, but that was decades ago and I am not so confident in my climbing abilities now. The best time to perfect rusty skills is not when a rhino is charging, but it is a good inspiration to try.\n\nA couple meters later the branches overhead began crashing and swaying. Gray Langur monkeys jumped through treetops, fleeing from our intruding group. Soon we passed wild chickens and then barking deer in a small clearing. Barking deer are quite small and bark like a dog when alarmed. The amount of wildlife we saw in ten minutes of walking amazed me.\n\nOur group left the wooded area and entered grassland scattered with small trees. The elephant grass, taller than our heads, surrounded us and made it impossible to see more than a couple meters in any direction. As we followed a dirt trail the thought we must be crazy to walk in the midst of wild animals crossed my mind several times and I gave Tim stern glances to communicate this. Careful not to make too much noise we talked in whispers and made our steps as light as possible. The temperature was scorching hot and the humidity so thick I could swim in it. Sweat dripped off our noses and down our backs.\n\nSuddenly, both guides stopped and motioned us to stand still. My body froze and so did my heart. Not far ahead two rhinos grazed. I could see the big round behind of the closest rhino and watched as it slowly turned toward us. The guides made quick upward hand movements signaling us to climb a tree and at lightning speed I quickly scaled the nearest tree, my heart beating so hard I was sure it would break through my chest. High off the ground I had a clear view of the closest rhino. It was a magnificent creature with gray thick skin resembling layered metal armour. \n\nIt's ears perked forward and it's nostrils widened, taking in deep breaths of human and absorbing our presence. Tim was still looking for a tree to climb when the rhino began running and let out a thunderous roar. I screamed and could only breathe again when Tim was safely high in a tree and the rhino had passed. We waited in our trees for what seemed a very short time when the guides told us to climb down. I think I could have stayed up there all day. I hugged the tree, thanking it for being there for me when I need it and descended. It took all my courage to begin walking again for the last few minutes had been some of the most frightening in my life. Only four more hours of walking left!\n\nThe rest of the walk was comparatively uneventful. Thankfully, we had no more live rhino encounters but saw lots of evidence of their proximity - huge fresh heaps of rhino dung, deposited to mark their territory greeted us often and their immense footprints in the soft mud reminded us to remain alert. By lunchtime we were safely back in town and I was never so glad to see civilization. People eating at outdoor restaurants, motorbikes, and souvenir shops insured me there were no charging rhinos around - besides, there weren't any good trees to climb.\n"

      "text": "Michelle and I sat on the back of the elephant with two other passengers. The four of us were crammed uncomfortably on top of a square railed platform with our backs to each other and our legs hanging off the corners like the four points of a compass. The driver sat along the elephant's neck. He steered its leathery ears with his bare feet and we lumbered down the dirt road to the Royal Chitwan National Park.\n\nThe park entrance is quite far from the elephant camp, so we spent the first hour bouncing through the villages and forests nearby.  Quiet village life went on around us - a group of basket-wielding women in hot red and pick saris laughed and socialized on the way to the fields. An old man cast his fishing net across the knee-deep water of a meandering stream. A young woman made breakfast on the adobe hearth outside her mud and thatched wood home. Close to the park entrance, herds of water buffalo grazed in a green pasture. We tiptoed through it on a multi-ton elephant and although I was dying to take photos of the people, I couldn't bring myself to do it from the back of an elephant. It would have had too much of a \"look mommy, natives!\" feel to it, don't you think?\n\nEverything changed once we entered the fringe of the park. The foliage deepened, the bird life hummed around us, and we spotted a rhino after only five minutes. To our surprise, the elephant driver bounced us to within a foot of the mud puddle the two-ton animal wallowed in. The rhino barely lifted his head to look at us before dropping it back into the mud apathetically.\n\nHe was built to fight, like a prehistoric tank.  Thick wrinkled body armor protected him from head to toe and even his tail fit neatly into a protective fold that kept it free from danger. I could picture him fighting off anything from a Jurassic Park movie. \n\nSeeing a rhino on an elephant was light years away from yesterday's experience on foot. We didn't need to worry about climbing trees, for one thing. But even more amazing is that the animals in the park seemed oblivious to our presence. We were invisible to everything, like the two sleeping sabar deer we spotted. If they had spotted us on foot, I would have only seen their rear ends running away. But today, they simply looked up at us a few feet nearby and went back to sleep. \n\nAfter we realized that we were safe up high on our elephant, we began to talk freely. The rhino's diamond shaped ears perked up with catlike twitches, but his eyes told him that the elephant in front was too large to charge. He looked up at us only occasionally and pretended we weren't there.\n\nShortly after we moved along, a brilliant blue peacock sailed from tree to tree above our heads. We passed rhesus macaque monkeys on the ground, cuckoos calling their own names, and wild chickens scuttling in the underbrush. But I really wanted to see another rhino and was happy to see not one, but two munching on grass in a clump of trees. Again, we stepped in close and watched freely as they ate.\n\nFive minutes after leaving this pair, we crested a small hill and almost - literally - ran into a rhino on the other side. The driver looked as startled as us.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, we ambled back to town alongside another group on an elephant. The drivers joked and knew each other well and egged on by us, soon started racing each other down the dirt streets through the village. Racing clearly wasn't a common occurrence here, because the same villagers who didn't look up this morning now shook with laughter as we passed.\n\nOur elephant deftly lumbered into the lead, but the opposition was clearly faster. So our driver zigzagged us across the road like a racecar driver guarding his lead. But our lead proved hard to hold and the challenger soon raced ahead of us. Happily, we stole back to the front when the other driver stopped paying attention.\n\nIt has to be said that racing an elephant is really uncomfortable. It is like racing in a car with wood seats and egg shaped wheels - you just bounce in all directions. But in the end, we arrived to the finish line first and were rewarded by being the first group to hop off and soothe our aching butts.\n"

      "text": "Somewhere in life I picked up the notion that Athens was a polluted city with crazy drivers. But having just traveled in India and Nepal, I feel I've arrived to a relaxed spotless wonderland. Nobody is coughing up gooey wads of phlegm from the depths of their lungs as they do every five minutes in Kathmandu. Nor are vehicles zigzagging at top speeds and full horn through twisted pedestrian lined streets as they do in India. It seemed so clean in Athens that when I looked down at the trash-free sidewalk, I had the disgusting thought that it was clean enough to lick!\n\nOn the other hand, costs are much higher and the mentality of the west is freaking me out. I am now sitting in a coffee shop with a cup of black coffee that costs five times more than it would in Asia. It is essentially the same coffee, even if it tastes like it has been smoldering on the burner all morning. Gone are my days of lounging in Asia at pennies a day - they have been replaced by the European need to move. Time is money. Even sitting here, cell phones break my peace and I feel the cost of my hotel nearby.\n\nEveryone in the west moves with a purpose. The streets are no longer full of people with idle hands and lots of time. Instead, the masses are hustling from place to place or hidden away in office complexes being productive. In this respect, the streets feel almost dead. In many ways, the life of a small village in Nepal feels more alive than the huge city of Athens.\n\nThe mentality of the west is efficient - like the woman in the sandwich shop in Athens who prepared food at a pace unseen in Asia. She was a one-woman production line who oozed perfection and made every movement count. I was amazed as she lined four bread rolls up and sliced each one with a quick swipe, concurrently checking her computer screen for orders. Then her hands went to work in a flurry of motion customizing orders and handing them out. Her movements ticked with all the precision of a Swiss watch.\n\nThe pace of her life was as \"west\" as the pace of a travel agency we visited in Kathmandu was \"east.\"  When we purchased tickets in Kathmandu for a simple flight, it took three people three hours to complete the task - they offered us tea, the office power went out, the modem connection was lost, and we chatted about the small things. The hurry was gone, replaced by casual conversation and a slower pace of life. \n\nThe mentality of the west is also material. It is a place where shiny glass and advertising frames stores selling luxury items such as designer clothes, cell phones, digital cameras, and leather shoes. At home I remember a feeling - a sick hunger almost - that urged me into stores and made me want to buy. This feeling literally made my mouth water and filled me with the anticipation of pleasure - a promised prize awaited my purchase, whether I bought a new CD or a new computer. And yet here in Athens, the advertising messages that surround me don't seem to have the same effect. I've slowed down to the pace of countries where the advertising is less conspicuous and people have only a fraction of the disposable income of the west.\n\nWhen you trek in Nepal, there are no televisions or billboards. You have no need for fashion, as you wear what keeps you warm and you are not out to impress people. Your attention turns to your surroundings - to places that are magnificent. But after almost three weeks in the mountains, I leafed through a German fashion magazine that a tourist left behind in a mountain lodge. Its glossy content promised all image and no substance. I saw the whole fashion industry in a new light - where I once saw glamorous women, I now saw emaciated models with ridiculous makeup and clothes that cost more than the average yearly salary of a Nepalese porter. I laughed. The existence of the life in the magazine felt light years from mine. \n\nSo what will I be like when I have a new job and money? Once the precise targeting and name branding of western advertisers makes its way back into my consciousness? I'm sure I'll revert back to my old habits. But perhaps I'll be a little wiser all the same."

Only 561 people live on the island year round, but the population swells with tourists in the summer. By the look of the empty streets we had clearly arrived outside of high season.\n\nAn empty bus hauled us up to the cliffside town of Hora on a road flanked by terraced farming hills. From above, the island probably looked like a life size topographical map. But from the bus, the dry rocky terrain outside of town looked desolate - supporting only desert shrubs, dry grasses, and a few stunted trees.\n\nOnce in Hora our bus driver discreetly asked if we needed a room. His shady demeanor made us a little nervous and his offer sounded too much like a drug dealer offering \"good stuff.\" But we followed him anyway and found a room far nicer than any we had stayed in months. With a TV, phone, fridge, and lots of other details not typically present in our budget trip, shady or not, the deal was too good to pass up.\n\nThe town looked fantastic. Wasting no time, we dropped our backpacks and left to explore.\n\nHora's adobe-styled buildings reminded me of the American Southwest - thick walls, rounded corners, and graceful archways. But the brilliant whitewash and deep blue trim that covered the town set it apart from anything I'd seen before. The contrast with the clear blue sky and surrounding sea was fantastic. The blue and white landscape felt uniquely Greek.\n\nSeven hundred years of history graces Hora with a timeless feel, from the old domed churches that cast white crosses against the Aegean sky, to the play of odd angles in the medieval section of town. A soft peace floated through the air and quieted my mind like meditation.\n\nLooking through town was the visual equivalent of a deep breath of fresh country air, where my vision became clearer and crisper than normal. Perhaps it is the dry air, strong sun, or contrasts in color that heightened my senses. But for whatever reason, I felt as though I just removed a pair of sunglasses only to discover that they were filthy and obscuring my vision. Suddenly, everything became sharp and beautiful and Hora was of my favorite destinations from this year of travel.\n"

      "text": "We ascended the Acropolis with flocks of noisy Greek school children who were herded quickly up the hill by fast talking teachers whose expressions clearly told each passerby, \"\"I don't get paid enough for this crap.\"\" But as much as I enjoyed watching the action of the comical crowds, I forced my attention away from the present and towards the past. I wanted to feel the history of what I was about to see.\n\nIt seems little coincidence that the Delphic Oracle planned the site 2500 years ago as the province of the gods and dedicated it to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. For here is a heavenly connection to the root of wisdom in every western nation. Our philosophy, architecture, democracy, literature, art, drama, and even sports owe a debt to the culture that erected these buildings. And so, the Acropolis is a direct link to our own past.\n\nWalking with the school children, we passed the Theater of Dionysus. This 17\t000-seat amphitheater was built in 161 AD and in its day, hosted dramas by Sophocles, Euripides, and other well-known writers. \n\nRising higher up the Acropolis, we entered the top of the plateau through what remains of the Propylaia's immense solid gates (erected in 437 BC). We passed though towering pillars and the view opened up to reveal the area's crown jewel: the famous Parthenon, one of the wonders of the world and an instantly recognizable symbol of international history.\n\nOne must have a grand imagination to envision how this building looked in its prime. \n\nI always thought of it as white marble. But in fact, brightly colored sculptures depicting marriage feasts, contests with centaurs, and mythic battles encircled the top of the building.  A 12-meter high ivory, gold plate, and jaded statue of Athena stood watch inside. Above her, a blue ceiling hung decorated with gilded stars. I built a fuzzy reconstruction in my mind and transported myself back hundreds of generations.\n\nJust down the hill, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle presented ideas that changed the world. A few hundred years later, the Apostle Paul argued the new religion of Christianity and won over Greece's first converts. \n\nThe Acropolis is a wonderful place for people with imagination and time to kill. For the majority of visitors, like the Princess Cruise group that I saw, a tour guide fires a 30 second history lesson into a crowd and sends them on their way with 20 minutes of free time. I was glad we were on our own to linger and enjoy."

      "text": "No one could ever accuse Greeks of being a meek and timid people. They are more like little firecrackers, ready to explode with opinions, greetings, laughter, or insults at any moment. I had to adjust to their way of communicating after coming from Southeast Asia, where showing strong emotion is equivalent to losing face.\n\nThe elderly are the most interesting to watch. The white haired women are short and stocky with large drooping bosoms, round buttocks, and their wrinkled faces clearly express it would be a mistake to get on their bad side. Their presence, whether standing on a balcony calling to neighbors below, watching grandchildren play in the park, or returning from the market carrying local produce, makes any stroll in Greece more interesting. They exude a quiet confidence, filling me with a sort of reverence as I watch them pass on the street, big hips swaying to their slow steady steps.\n\nThe old men can be seen socializing together on benches in the village square, their conversations growing loud and animated and then fading to contemplative silence, almost in a rhythmic pattern. The men also hang in kafeneia, Greek cafes serving only men. I peek in the windows of the smoke-filled rooms as I walk past and see men playing cards together, reading the paper, or participating in animated discussions.\n\nWhen the Greeks are unhappy they are not shy about expressing their anger. I met a couple from Florida who had this tale to tell: Walking in Plaka, the old city of Athens, a kind, grandmotherly-type shop owner ushered the couple into her store with a smile. They had read in their guidebook it was appropriate to bargain and, after browsing, picked an item and asked for a reduced price. They must have bargained too low for the woman's demeanor changed instantly and she began yelling, hurling insults, and chasing them from the store. They ran down the street as people stared and felt like they had just been caught shoplifting instead of trying to make a business transaction.\n\nWe were on a public bus in Athens and the driver stopped too quickly, sending an elderly woman to the floor with a thud. She rose unscathed, and united with all the other women aboard, they proceeded to ream the driver with a cacophony of verbal insults. The driver just watched stone-faced through his rear view mirror with an air of unconcern, as if this was an every day occurrence. \n\nAnother time we were on a train, waiting at the station to leave when a young couple boarded and sat at the far end of the carriage. An irate old man followed û I presume the girl's father û yelling and screaming. All the passengers' necks stretched to get a better view of the red-faced man shouting and projecting spittle inches from the couple's faces. It was too much stress for the young man who escaped to the train's toilet until the tirade was over, leaving the girl to fend for herself. She sat staring out the window and puffing on her cigarette, indifferent as the bus driver had been when his passenger was flung to the bus floor due to his bad driving. \n\nThe old man was putting on an impressive show involving his whole body: feet stamping, finger wagging, arms waving, eyes bulging, and repeatedly pointing to his heart. Since all the screaming was in Greek I made up my own story about the conflict û the girl was running away with the young man to Athens and the father didn't approve. He was screaming for her to return home and she was breaking his heart with her disobedience. It was a stirring story of family loyalty and romance, but of course, for all I knew, he could have been yelling at her for cooking a lousy breakfast and giving him heartburn. When the train whistle blew signaling departure, he stopped screaming, straightened his collar, and calmly departed. The young man didn't emerge from the toilet until the train was moving and the coast was clear.\n\nI don't think these emotional explosions are uncommon among the Greeks. We have witnessed many as we travel through the country and I am impressed by the energy that goes into an argument û shaking fingers, shrugging shoulders, waving arms, and fists pounding chests. It has the same intensity as a maestro conducting an orchestra with concentration and passion.\n\nWhere the Greeks can be passionate in their anger, I find they can be equally passionate in their kindness. A Greek couple we met on the plane from Nepal spent hours with us, giving us advice and tips for our time in Greece. Old women squeeze my arms in affection as I pass; old men holler the Greek hello, \"Yasas!\"  A hotel owner brought freshly baked cake to our room, still steaming from the oven. After a wonderful meal, a restaurant owner brought wine and a plate of fruit to the table, on the house. These are only a few examples of the kindness shown to us while touring Greece.\n\nWith a history of strong tradition, mythic gods battling in the heavens, festive dancing, great wine, and the birthplace of democracy, it is no wonder Greece is a land of passionate people. The enthusiasm and zeal they show in expressing themselves is an art form in itself. \n"

Perched on a stone wall, we nibbled on bread and cheese and watched the local life: an old man and his donkey passed, a gang of five tiny dogs raced by, looking like they owned the streets, children on bikes whizzed by, and then an old man shuffled by, still in his pajamas.\n\nI needed to buy a dress for the wedding we were attending in a couple days but there were no clothe shops to be found on the island. I wondered where the locals bought clothes. It is obvious they bought them somewhere -they all seemed adequately dressed (except the old man in pajamas - he could have used a new outfit).\n\nMy dress dilemma was solved when I discovered a man selling clothes out of a van in the main square. He had arrived on the morning ferry. His green van was stacked high with blue jeans, t-shirts, dress shirts, and a couple dresses. I browsed through the van door while waiting for some local women to make their purchases and then I bought a simple black and white dress. Perfect!\n\nHora sits on the top of a cliff overlooking the sea and in the afternoon we stopped at a white washed wall to gaze at the aqua blue sea below. I could stare at the water all day, letting my eyes swim in its rich, deep color. A cat approached and rubbed against my leg. The population of Hora might be small but its cat population is thriving. Cats roam the streets freely and can be seen rummaging through trash bins, emerging from small crevasses, sunning on walls and doorsteps, and begging beside cafe tables. It is hard to resist their huge cat eyes begging for food. But give a tiny morsel of food and soon your table is surrounded by cats of all sizes and colors serenading your meal in a loud symphony of meows.\n\nLate in the evening we walked up a stone path to the church overlooking the town. Along the way we met some of the local residents: a snake, a donkey, and a herd of goats. I could have done without meeting the snake! We ended our idyllic day by watching the hot pink sunset from large rocks on the edge of a cliff.\n"

      "text": "Our hotel lies one block from the Chios main port and I decided to spend the final moments of evening light by the water. I found an empty bench on the walkway lining the harbor's edge. The water's surface was calm, still, and looked soft like velvet. Boats floated by, lights reflected off the water's surface, and local residents were out for an evening stroll. Parents pushed babies in strollers, lovers held hands, and friends conversed. People seemed to have no particular destination or time restraints - they were out to just enjoy the evening together. It gave me a wonderful feeling of community and that all was well in Chios.\n\nBehind me cars and motorcycles zipped by on the street and a long row of cafes did a brisk business serving beer and coffee to customers at the outdoor tables. I watched as an old woman started to cross the busy street, hobbling with a cane. Her large plump body was easy to spot and the traffic stopped quickly, leaving plenty of space for her to cross. I chuckled when she paused in the middle of the street to shout a few cross words, wave her cane in the air, and wag her finger at the vehicles, as if to reprimand and warn them not to approach any closer.  The growing long line of cars just waited patiently until she had hoisted her large body safely on to the curb before resuming their activity.\n\nShe turned my direction and when she approached, it was as if we had been good friends for a long time. Her entire face lit up and, despite all the empty space on the bench, she plopped down so close to me our hips touched. She grabbed my arm, squeezed it with affection, and began to rapidly speak in Greek. Not wanting to embarrass her, I meekly told her I only spoke English, hoping she understood. She paused to look at me carefully, studying my face and then with a comprehending nod responded, \"Ah, English!\" I smiled in relief thinking I was saved from an awkward situation.\n\nBut then she went right on speaking Greek! I tried to listen as words gushed from her mouth but I understood nothing - after all, it was all Greek to me. Eventually I just relaxed, watched her gestures and got the gist of her words. She pointed to passing boats, giving what sounded like a discourse on each one. She discussed the passers-by and grew particularly animated when babies passed. At one point, she paused long enough to fish in her large handbag and produce a piece of gum for me. I chewed happily with minty breathe as she continued to talk and explain an injury, pointing to her wrapped ankle and silver-tipped cane. Through it all I nodded frequently, content to be a listening ear. \n\nAfter a while she gave my arm another affectionate squeeze, stood, and slowly began her next journey - to the next bench over. The sun had set by now and I headed back to my hotel in twilight, thankful for the chatty encounter."

The market takes place at one end of town on stone-walled terraced levels, merchants displaying their goods on blankets spread on the ground.

It is a crowded  sea of activity with people pushing and shoving to move forward, dogs barking, roosters crowing, tourists clicking cameras, women socializing, men bargaining, and merchants yelling out prices.\n\nYesterday, walking eight hours from Gokyo, we passed many women walking to Namche for the market. A procession of laughing, chattering women, I could tell this was an important weekly social event. Without radios, television, and roads in this remote region, market day must be an anticipated time to see friends and buy much needed items."

In the long-standing feud between these two countries, perhaps no self-respecting Greek would dare to cross the line into Turkey. But for whatever reason, we ferried from Greece to Turkey with little clue as to what lay ahead.\n\nOur 45 minute ferry ride from Chios landed us in &Ccedil;esme, a surprisingly upscale resort town, where we spent the afternoon strolling through the boutique lined cobblestone streets and a cafe covered beach front. In the late afternoon, sun lit the 700-year old &Ccedil;esme Castle with a warm golden glow. We ate our first Turkish meal in the castle's tower while looking down at an ice cream vendor doing brisk business in the pedestrian plaza below. Our rice stuffed peppers, calamari, eggplant salad, and green beans were served with bread and a cold Efes beer. I think I'm going to like it here."

In our short 1 1/2 hour journey from &Ccedil;esme to Izmir (in a brand new Mercedes bus), a conscientious attendant offered us no less than hand disinfectant, bottled water, and hot coffee, tea, or soda.  The service rivaled any airline, yet the price, at about $2.50\twas as low as a city subway ticket.\n\nOnce in Izmir's southern bus station, we hired a cab to the city center. Kilometers of blocky 7-10 story apartments rolled by my window like a rolling stage backdrop. A typical uninspiring cityscape - endless grey buildings encircled by balconies and digital satellite dishes, with banks, cafes, mom & pop grocers, and clothing stores on the street level. \n\nSurely a 5000-6000-year old city had more to offer? We checked into an \"\"otel\"\" and joined the city's leisurely Sunday strollers to find out for ourselves.\n\nWe walked first to Izmir's 100-year old Ottoman clock tower and watched the pedestrians in the busy Konak Square pass by. Several stopped at the wash basins surrounding the base of the monument to splash around in the water and quash the midday heat. A shoeshine boy plucked down next to us on a makeshift tin can seat. He jokingly asked if my beat up sandals needed a shine, then pursued Michelle's suede hiking boots with a brush despite her repeated \"\"no's\"\". We left him behind in the plaza a few moments later, still requesting money that we were not about to give him.\n\nThe nearby Izmir bazaar buzzed with weekend browsers and eager shopkeepers trying to turn our heads with, \"\"Where are you from?\"\" and other pre-sale pleasantries. I was neither in the mood to buy nor carry in my backpack any of their leather works, shoes, Turkish carpets, cell phones, watches, or other goods, so I declined every advance. The only person who tempted me was a street vendor filling the bazaar with the aroma of fried fish. Customers circled around him, eating his fish on paper plates with a wedge of lemon.\n\nWe walked north of the bazaar and through the gates of the K&uuml;lt&uuml;rpark. This large city park offers its city residents a zoo, amusement park, roller skating rink, and restaurants in addition to greenery and gardens. We drank a cup of thick Turkish coffee in an open cafe, between couples sharing tea from wood burning semavers (samovars) and men smoking tobacco from giant hookahs.\n\nIn the evening, the air cooled down to the perfect silky temperature between warm and cold. We found a pleasant harbor-side park overlooking the Aegean Sea and watched the last vestiges of daylight fade from red to purple. The rest of Izmir seemed out to join us, as even at 9 PM the park benches and jogging trails were full of couples and families enjoying the last few hours of their weekend.\n\nWe ate a Turkish pudding and watched a vibrant city at play.

Greek ferries are large and spacious vessels offering carpeted floors, snack bars, lounges, and comfortable chairs. But when we boarded the ferry the niceness of it was hidden by sleeping bodies strewn on chairs and the floor. Passengers who had boarded six hours earlier in Athens had marked their territory with luggage, belongings, and their own bodies. Entering the lobby we stepped over an overweight woman who had made the space near the doorway her bed. Out cold, she was oblivious to the traffic milling around her head. On the floor, bare feet shot out from under rows of seats and I morbidly thought they looked like dead corpses being stored with the luggage.\n\nIt took us a while to find a seat. Every time we found unoccupied seats and sat down we would be shooed away minutes later by people claiming the seats were saved. After a couple of repeat occurrences I felt like I was playing a sick game of musical chairs and found my patience tested. Finally, Tim and I split up to fend for ourselves and I found an empty seat wedged between two snoring, sunburned tourists. \n\nI knew sleep would not be an option -the lights blared overhead and music seeped from a nearby television. Every once in a while a senior citizens group in the lounge would burst into song. The hours ticked by slowly and I tried to keep a positive attitude despite my losing battle to inner grumbles. I realize long rides, sleepless nights, and unpredictable events are part of the adventure of travel. The good thing is I usually forget the pain and inconveniences once I arrive at a destination and only remember the excitement of it all.\n\nOur ferry arrived in the Samos main port at 7 a.m. and we were welcomed by the quiet of a Sunday morning, except for the ringing of church bells. The port town, Vathy, reflected everything I thought a Mediterranean town should be - Venetian designed stately buildings topped in terracotta tiled roofs, a walkway lined with swaying palm trees, plenty of cafes to drink coffee, blue water, and bright sun.

As Bill is an aspiring actor and screenwriter, maybe it will see the silver screen someday. If so, the wedding would go a little like this...\n\n<hr>\n\n<b>Plot Summary</b>\nA Greek American visits his ancestral homeland for the first time, where he marries his American fiance. Beautiful scenery surrounds the action that culminates in a huge wedding feast and party with 38 friends and family members from home.\n\n<b>Location</b>\nThe town of Fira, on the Greek isle of Santorini. This charming cliff side town overlooks a 3000-year-old volcano caldera, now flooded with the waters of the Aegean Sea. Old white buildings, luxury hotels, and beautiful churches climb from the waterside to the top of the precipice.\n\n<b>The Players</b>\n<u>Groom</u>: Bill is a handsome New York actor and writer in his early thirties who grew up in a small Greek community in Ohio. In addition to learning Greek from his parents at an early age, he is an accomplished Greek dancer. \n\n<u>Bride</u>: Cecilia is a stunning blonde New York advertising executive with an effervescent personality and a love of life. Though not of Greek descent, she has an interest in learning the Greek language and culture.\n\n<u>Kumbada</u>: The Kumbada plays an important part in a Greek wedding by directing the ceremony and symbolically creating the matrimonial bond between husband and wife. Played by Bill's middle brother, Steve, whose affable personality and steadfast character are important in this role. \n\n<u>The Best Man</u>: Bill's youngest brother, Mo, is a bulky New York personal trainer and student. He sports a mean goatee, short cropped hair, and cool black suit. Back at home, he could pass as a Mafia hit man.\n\n<b>The Plot</b>\n<u>Act 1</u>: The Wedding\nThe scene starts late afternoon with guests waiting in front of the Metropoli Church of the Blessed Mary, a large Greek Orthodox cathedral overlooking the sea. Music rising from a balcony below draws the wedding guests to the cliff side overlook. Led by musicians, the wedding party makes their grand entrance into the pedestrian plaza.\n\nEnter the cathedral. Byzantine frescos along the inner walls and upper dome depict scores of hallowed saints and the Virgin Mary with baby Jesus. A vessel by the door holds thin burning prayer candles. The wedding party approaches the bushy bearded Greek Orthodox priest, who stands aside the altar wearing his traditional black robe and hat. \n\nThe priest and cantor start the service in a duet of hymns. After a short gospel reading in Greek, the bride and groom reverently kiss the gospel and the priest's hand. The priest then blesses the rings, which are lying on a silver tray surrounded by chocolate covered almonds (koufeta). The Kumbada places a garland of lace and flowers upon the heads of Bill and Cecilia. This crown, the stefana, is connected by a ribbon and symbolizes a noble marriage and the beginning of a dynasty between the new couple. The Kumbada switches the stefana from head to head three times by crossing arms. \n\nThe couple drinks from a goblet of blessed wine, then take their marriage vows together in both Greek and English. Newly married, they symbolize their travels in life together by circling the altar three times while the guests throw rice and cheer them on. Lastly, they signify their everlasting relationship by switching rings three times.\n\n<u>Act 2</u>: The Toast</u>\nThe wedding guests follow Bill and Cecilia down a cobblestone path to a reception patio. In a symbol of fertility, the guests eat bites of chewy honey-almond dessert as they pass through the threshold. Champagne is passed around and by the light of a Santorini sunset, the best man gives a toast to the newlyweds and then husband and wife cut the wedding cake.\n\n<u>Act 3</u>: The Party</u>\nA hired bus whisks the wedding guests off to the beachside town of Perivolous and the party starts in earnest - with the screech of brakes and several loud explosions from the restaurateur's powerful homemade gunpowder and sea salt explosives. Guests periodically throw these to the ground throughout the night, no doubt causing fear among those with poor hearts. \n\nA feisty five piece Greek band strikes up and appetizers fill the table - bread, tzatziki (yogurt and cucumber dip), fava beans, fried feta cheese, cold feta cheese, Greek salads, cherry tomatoes, fried eggplant and zucchini, and little sausages. The guests laugh, drink, and eat so much that a palette cleansing dance session is ordered. Bill and Cecilia start the first dance with the accompaniment of an accordion, guitar, singer, violin, and tambourine. The families join in for a Greek circle dance, with each dancer clasping hands on their neighbor's shoulder, kicking and stepping collectively to the beat.\n\nAppetites return in time for the fish course - crispy kalamari, little red fish, succulent white fish, and delicious lobster. More circle dancing follows.\n\nDinner continues with homemade liver sausage and lamb. In the third round of dancing that follows, the circle of dancers soon overgrows the restaurant and spills out into the street. The tempo of the music gradually quickens until the band is playing at a furious pace. Guests struggle to keep their feet moving to the beat. Faster and faster, their feet are in a frenzy of motion. The restaurateur and other guests celebrate outside with blasts from the 12-gauge shotgun he brought out from the back. The roar is deafening, but the noise no longer fazes the guests. \n\nThe movie ends with a party on wheels, as 38 people return to Fira on a crazy 2 AM bus ride, dancing in the aisles.\n\n<hr>\n\nSo maybe this won't make it to Hollywood, but I still wish Bill and Cecilia all the best anyway. Congratulations!\n\n"

We are just tagging along, honored to witness the reunion!"

Each cabin has its own bathroom, there are comfortable mats to lay on the deck, a hammock, and snorkeling equipment. The itinerary is to visit different stops along the way - a gorge with a waterfall, ancient ruins along the coast, small islands, seaside villages, and end the journey down the coast in Olympos.

I fell asleep to the gentle rocking of the boat, to the sound of music and laughter coming from surrounding boats in the cove, and to the moon slowly rising over a mountain silhouette. I awoke at 5 am to the pink dawn, calm water, and precious silence.\n\nAt 6 am the boat engine roared to life and we set off into the open water. Over the next hour a couple people woke and joined me on the deck. We sat in silence, wrapped in blankets, each lost in the quiet of the morning as wind whipped through our hair and the waves rhythmically lifted the boat up and down. Suddenly, we were shaken from our meditative states by three dolphins jumping playfully at the front of the boat. They jumped through the waves and soon were swimming along side us. I leaned as far over the railing as I could and watched their sleek gray bodies swim gracefully below until they disappeared into the blue depths. The unexpected encounter filled me with wonder and excitement.\n\nWe spent the day doing what people do on lazy boat cruises: eating, swimming, snorkeling, sun bathing, relaxing, and docking for a couple hours to explore a small seaside village. In the evening we anchored off a deserted island covered with ancient ruins. We feasted on a dinner of grilled eggplant, peppers, onions, chicken, and potatoes, while sipping wine and enjoying each other's company. After dinner some people went ashore and sat around a blazing bonfire while the rest of us turned up the music and danced on the boat until after midnight.\n\nI fell asleep on the deck under the stars; content I spent a day close to perfection."

So I was surprised to learn Turkey, although 99% Muslim, overflows in early Christian history.\n\nSelcuk, a town a couple kilometers off the west coast, is a wonderful place to begin to rectify my ignorance. St. John, an apostle and writer of the Holy Bible, retired and died here. It is also believed he brought the Virgin Mary here after the death of Christ, where she too spent her final days. Nearby is Ephesus, home of the Church of Ephesus, one of the seven Asian churches in Revelations and a city where St. Paul preached, spreading Christianity.\n\nWe arrived in Selcuk by bus in the morning, leaving a whole day to roam its streets. We visited its museum, ate lunch in an outdoor cafe and then wandered up a hill to the St. John Church, a 6th-century basilica built over St. John's tomb. Although mostly a crumbling ruin, it was fun to walk among the large stones strewn about, lone columns standing that once supported huge domes, and up stairways that led  no where, the second floor long gone.\n\nIf the church was fully restored it would be the 7th largest cathedral in the world. Its surviving foundation clearly showed its immense size. St. John's tomb lay at the top of the cruciform shaped church surrounded by the remains of cracked marble floor and beautiful mosaic tiles, now exposed to wind, rain, and sun under the open sky.\n\nI walked to the edge of the hill and looked out to the vast plain below, stretching to the horizon with miles and miles of farmland. I imagined John sitting as an old man under the willow trees, writing his Gospel while gazing at the same view. I wonder if he had any idea this new religion he was promoting would change the world forever."

It was then I realized we were walking on top of an ancient city covered with centuries of earth. I stooped down and picked up one of the many pieces of brick covering the ground, fragments of old roof tiles probably over a 1000-years old. It blows my mind away to stand on top of what was once a prosperous community of markets, public baths, theaters, and houses, and now, due to invasions, earthquakes, and natural erosion, is a pile of rock and earth I am climbing over and exploring.\n\nBuried under me was probably clay jars for holding water and wine, coins, jewelry and hair clips, and other household items from long ago. And I think of thousands of years from now into the future when others are walking over the ruins of our great cities - maybe New York, LA, or London and finding the remains of a civilization - a comb, a car tire, a plastic cup. Like these once thriving kingdoms, ours too will some day fade and be replaced. It is the nature of time."

The steady rumble of a bus usually has a way of coaxing me into a drooling, sleepy stupor, but I was successful in fighting off sleep during the 5 hour journey and was rewarded with sights from the Turkish countryside and small towns. I have found the Turkish cities quite modern, abounding in ATMs, cell phones, and fast food restaurants. The countryside offers the opposite view - a timelessness of people making a living off the land, small town communities, and a simpler life. \n\nThe bus wound its way along fields rich in shimmering gold wheat rotated with rows of green vegetables. The effect was a giant natural quilt blanketing the land until it reached a mountain's edge. The shades of greens and yellows against the blue sky and the softness of the grass as the wind swept through it gave me the same sense of awe I get when gazing at a blazing sunset.\n\nWhen we entered towns along the way, I soaked in the people and their way of life. An old woman sat on a donkey, her long white head covering flapping in the wind. A camel, piled high in Turkish rugs, looked like a small wool mountain strolling down the street. Old men, wearing dark hats, vests, and serious expressions, sat in small groups in the shade. School children in blue and white uniforms stopped at a community fountain and drank from a plastic cup attached to the fountain by a string. We passed many elderly couples getting around by horse and cart and farmers selling produce on the side of the road.\n\nPeople continued to board and get off the bus as they reached their destinations. By late afternoon we were the only passengers left. The remaining part of the journey was through a rocky mountain pass with windy roads. I watched in fascination and disgusted amusement as the bus driver spent the entire final hour picking his nose with an intensity and concentration usually associated with brain surgery. Half his index finger would be lost in one nostril, swirled around, and then he would switch sides. After the first 20 minutes I was positive there could be no possible way anything could be left to pick. But his digging continued for another 40 minutes! A couple times I was alarmed he might drive off the road, as his attention was not on his driving.\n\nI was relieved when we finally reached our destination, Fethiye, a seaside town with a large marina and nearby beaches."

      "text": "We traveled today with Bill (or Vasili as he is known in Greece) and his family to the village of his father's childhood. Rather than write about this ourselves, Bill was kind enough to write this excellent entry for us:\n\n<hr/>\n\nI stood watching from the shore beneath the afternoon sun, thinking how they must feel. Much time had passed since they said their good-byes. And a lot had taken place. Like two energetic kids without a care in the world, the men splashed and swam about the warm Northern Aegean water as I sat on one of the large black stones that blanketed the beach. \n\n\"Swim on out here, you chicken!\" Stamatie exclaimed to my dad from the shore's far reaches. \n\n\"You better hope I don't\" he replied. \"If I get my hands on you, you're going under!\" he said before cracking into laughter. \n\nIt was the first time I heard my dad called a chicken. And I was thrilled. \n\nMy dad told me countless childhood stories of he and his best friend, Stamatie, swimming in this very spot. The two grew up together in the rural Greek Island village that sat 1,000 meters above our heads, carved out from the rugged mountain side. \n\n\"The water is crystal clear which you can see to the bottom – even from the village\" he would tell me as I lay in bed. \n\nStamatie then focused his attention to me, still on the rock, as I watched this momentous occasion unfold. \n\n\"Yasou Vasili!\" he bellowed in a deep rich tone. \"Get out here!\" he added, cupping his mouth while staying afloat. \n\nI made my way to the water. The black stones were smooth, pill-shaped and large enough to stand on. I couldn't stay on any particular rock for more than a few seconds as they retained the sun's heat quite well, scorching the bottoms of my feet. Each rock served as a springboard to the next, which led me to the refreshing placid water that had been calling my name for years. \n\n\"I was home\" I thought to myself after diving beneath the surface and watching a school of fish swim by. \n\nI came up gasping for air and saw dad and mom, now in the water's depths with Stamatie. Then I looked for my wife. I turned back towards shore and saw her, my unparalleled inspiration, swimming with Tim, another inspiration. A dear friend and cohort of inebriated mayhem of years past; Tim was an ever-evolving individual in search of his next adventure. His girlfriend Michelle, I learned, was cut from the same cloth. \n\nTim and Michelle were traveling the world. They quit their jobs, left all behind and would go on to inspire anyone who would ever read their exotic and captivating stories posted on their web site. Starting in Panama and continuing through the hidden worlds of Asia, they made their way to Greece joining Cecilia and I along with thirty-six other family members and friends from the States, for our wedding. The site of Cecilia and Tim swimming together, back dropped on the opal beach humbled me in the same manner as did the site of my dad and Stamatie picking up where they had left off forty-six years earlier. \n\nEarlier that day I had rented a Jeep, which gave me a sense of security for what lay ahead. Tim secured the magnificently compact Fiat Panda, whose tires were as wide as a ten-speed bicycle. We left the town center and followed signs to the village, and started by climbing a series of treterous switchbacks that propelled us high over the town center, giving us a breathtaking view of the port and neighboring Turkey. The road had no guardrails to keep us from plummeting over its narrow path. The steep road kept us at a constant incline while our seats bore the brunt of our weight. With every hair pinned turn I met, I could feel my heart pound in sync with the revving engine. In the Jeep, we sat perched even higher from the road's surface. But I remained cool and toggled between first and second gears with a smooth clutch action allowing for a sweet symphony to emanate from the transmission below. I felt pretty good. \n\n\"You know, Vasili failed the maneuverability portion of his driver's test\" mom said. \n\nSilence fell on us all as she laughed out loud in a hearty tone, breaking the tension that she just had supplied. \n\nThe only person in the Jeep with me who didn't feel any fear was dad. On this very road which was once a dirt and stone path, he and his uncle would make the 10-hour trek to the town center by donkey to sell their harvests of olives, plumbs and lemons. Now things were in perspective and with one eye on the road and the other focused on the Panda in my rear view mirror, we continued up the mountainside to the village. \n\nA lifetime of questions and events ran through my mind as we passed olive, fig, lime, and almond groves. I thought back to my childhood in a small Ohio, steel mill town. Most of Egrigoros' inhabitants immigrated there in the 1950's, after learning of the plethora of unskilled and highly paid steel-mill jobs. My great uncle Modestos led the wave. He first arrived, scouted the land, and sent back word for the rest to follow. It was a prosperous time filled with unheard possibilities for those who came from the village's dirt floor homes. In America they were able to buy land, fertile, unlike the rocky mountainside to which they were accustomed. They built homes with indoor plumbing, and garaged black topped driveways, which they filled with automobiles. This, along with every other hair-raising notion of what America offered, called them in droves. \n\nWhen the recession of the 1980's hit, the small town felt its impact. The treat of Japanese steel crept into our sleepy hollow, forcing riotous union meetings, wildcat strikes and crippling work stoppages. All feared for the worst. Husbands were laid-off and wives sought work cleaning homes and ironing clothes. Slowly, the steel mills began to grind to a debilitating halt, which transcended to every immigrant's kitchen table. \n\n\"Times were tough,\" I thought to myself, but we somehow managed. \n\nAs we neared the village, we were greeted by kilometers of Sparta bushes lining the road. They were small bright yellow flowers whose intoxicating fragrance wanted to put me to sleep. They filled the air, setting the tone for that June afternoon. With Cecilia as my navigator, ever glued to a map, we passed a sign that read \"Egrigoros, 2km.\" \n\n\"I never thought I'd ever see that,\" I said to my passengers, recalling my dream of visiting the place of my father's birth. \n\nAfter our hour-and-a-half long vertical climb, we arrived in the village. Egrigoros was comprised of fifty or so small huddled homes, all of which were hand built of stone and mortar with terracotta and slate roofs. Some homes were built into the mountain itself. Others stood freely, tethered to poles by telephone, electrical, and clotheslines. There were no streets in the village, only cemented walking paths, which intimately wrapped around the houses connecting the families as one. We learned that less than six families live in the village year round. Each family, whose roots were planted in Egrigoros, still kept a home here. Most were in great condition as they served as summer retreats. Others still, were neglected and overgrown with fig trees, Sparta, and wild brush. \n\nAt the top of the village sat the olive oil factory, which I later learned was built by another uncle of mine who had operated it for the past 35-years. As we drove down the village's dirt road entrance and parked our cars, I saw a lone man standing at the far end. \n\nHe seemed tall and strong, and was lit by the descending sun. A coifed thick white cloud of hair hung over his stark black eyebrows. Then I saw his eyes, sheer blue in color, radiating warmth as they introduced themselves. \n\n\"Stamatie\" I whispered to myself. \n\n\"Yasou Modestos!\" he enthusiastically yelled out which seemed to have echoed throughout Egrigoros and on to the neighboring village. \n\n\"Yasou Stamatie!\" dad replied, matching his excitement. \n\nThe men greeted one another like brothers. Their hands met for a much overdue handshake, which pulled them into each other's arms, laughing like the kids they were. \n\nEverything at that moment seemed to move in a slow and subtle manner. I turned to Cecilia who could only smile watching the moment. My brothers were taken aback by Stamatie, as was I, who looked just as he did in the only photograph we had of him. It was taken the day dad left the village. Both teenagers were proudly dressed in suites, standing with arms on the other's shoulders. Much hadn't changed. Mom ran to Stamatie and embraced him with a loving hug. I then turned to Tim and Michelle who simply watched as the villagers came running out, welcoming us all to their home. "

When the call is broadcast simultaneously from every mosque in a city at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, dusk, or after dark, the haunting sounds echo from every direction and make the otherwise secular streets feel holy. \n\nThe family who runs the <a href='http://www.lalehostel.com'>Lale Hostel</a> here in Egirdir is a friendly bunch. The owner Ibrahim is a helpful guy and as Ibrahim proudly told us, his father is a muezzin with an excellent voice. When I asked Ibrahim about hearing his father sing, he didn't hesitate in sending me down to the mosque to watch the call to prayer. I jumped at the opportunity just a few minutes before his father was due in the service and found myself bounding through the darkened nighttime streets behind him, wondering what I was in store for. We arrived to a locked mosque at around 10 PM and waited for the Imam to arrive with the keys. \n\nOur awkward conversation crawled along with language problems, as Ibrahim's father spoke to me in broken English and I spoke to him in the few Turkish words I knew. But I didn't need spoken language to realize he wore a genuine smile with his gentle personality. \n\nThe Imam arrived with a trickle of other followers who chatted amicably amongst each other. Once they established that I spoke no Turkish, I dissolved into the background and spent the time watching people ritually cleanse themselves in the ablution fountain nearby. \n\nWith the Imam's signal, Ibrahim's father enclosed himself into a phone booth sized recording booth below the minaret and sang the call to prayer. I heard his voice as an even mix, half muffled through the wooden door and half broadcast from the loudspeakers high above my head. But still, Ibrahim was right to be proud. His father's voice was enchanting.\n\nThe prayer ended three minutes later and as I readied to leave, Ibrahim's father surprised me with an invitation to watch the actual prayers inside the mosque.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but removed my shoes and followed him in.\n\nThe Quran forbids displaying images of Muhammad and other religious leaders, so unlike Christians who decorate their churches with images of Christ, Muslims decorate their mosques with prayers rendered into flowing calligraphic paintings. These paintings hung on the walls alongside two loud clocks that broke the room's silence with steady ticking.\n\nI knew virtually nothing about the ritualized Islamic prayer and felt naturally out of place. But I'd been invited in and none of the 9 people in the room seemed bothered by my presence. So I stood in the back and observed silently.\n\nIbrahim's father started the 20 minutes of prayers with his smooth voice. Participants then followed the Imam in prayers, standing, kneeling, and pressing their foreheads down to the red carpeted floor. The Imam's transformation amazed me. Ten minutes ago he looked like a normal everyday guy and now, he was a black robed holy man with a cylindrical turban. The Imam's deeper voice chanted in turns with the Muezzin in a mesmerizing duet that made me soon forget my doubts about coming. \n\nThe participants practiced other parts of the ritual, mouthing silent prayers, placing their hands up to the heavens, and fingering rosary beads. The Imam ended the session with a prayer and the participants exited silently.\n\nI tried to express my sincere gratitude to Ibrahim's father when I walked back to the hostel with him. He offered me a real glimpse of Turkey that I will not soon forget.\n\nListen to the <a href=\"/audio/mp3/turkish_call_to_prayer.mp3\">Turkish Call To Prayer</a> and the <a href=\"/audio/mp3/turkish_prayer.mp3\">Turkish Mosque</a> recordings in the <a href=\"/sounds\">Sounds</a> section."

Developers responded with a unique solution - they built tree houses for the tourists. And now, the tree houses lure the hordes more than the historic ruins.\n\nOur tree house looks more like a primitive wooden house on six-foot stilts rather than a proper tree house. But many others in town live up to their name and keep me looking for a loincloth-clothed Tarzan to come swinging down to earth yodeling.\n\nThe area is bracketed by tall cliffs and a nearby beach. With the shady fruit trees that grow everywhere, the unhurried clientele who create an easy going atmosphere, and a $6 per night cost (per person/including breakfast and dinner), I think we can afford to spend a few days here."

The old stonewall we sat on enclosed a field of wildflowers and provided a nice vantage point to survey the village - old homes, a mosque in the center of town, and a farmer driving his tractor around.\n\nA group of women in flowery dresses and headscarves busied themselves around washtubs full of water and what looked like wheat. Our curiosity attracted theirs until one of them broke the silence, pointing to one of the large washtubs and exclaiming, \"baklava.\"  I wasn't sure how a large tub of vegetable matter could be a philo dough pastry, so I thumbed though a worn vocabulary book and jokingly shouted out food items made with wheat. She nodded and laughed with each one, finally confirming what was in the tubs when I found the Turkish word for wheat. Michelle offered them oatmeal cookies and they responded with homemade stuffed grape leaves.\n\nFurther down the road, two older women sat on a wall with a ten-year-old girl. Like with many children in modern Turkey, the girl's modern T-shirt-shirt and jeans posed a striking contrast between her two traditionally dressed elders. She welcomed us with a handful of freshly picked cherries and we pantomimed a conversation with the trio for a half an hour.\n\nThe overlook at the end of the road offered an exceptional view of Egirdir from above. A sweet old couple beckoned for us to sit around a few plastic tables and eat from their restaurant, which turned out to be a funky little shack nearby. Michelle entered the shack to watch the woman cook, while I sat outside enjoying the view and freezing my head with the coldest, most satisfying bottle of water that I've ever been served."

After spending the  night on an 11-hour bus ride full of smoking Bulgarians, the crisp morning air that greeted me felt heavenly. A few deep breathes later I started walking towards town.\n\nAt that early hour, Sophia showed few signs of life - just random early risers, an occasional car, and shops clamped down for the night with rolled steel storefronts. I walked into an unlocked hostel and slept on a couch until the proprietor woke and gave me a bed.\n\nDaytime Sophia greeted me with a whole new image. The sleepy town I saw had morphed into a city of contrasts, where the evolution from communism to free-market economy manifests itself on every street. Where a glittering upscale shoe store sits on the first floor of a grotty communist-era concrete building. Or a brand new Mercedes parks next to an old Russian Lada. The antiquated streetcars now scrape through a city in a state of change. \n\nIt didn't take me long to warm up to the city. Sophia's wide boulevards and light car traffic furnish it with an open feel.  Lively street-side cafes serve espressos to people who seem to have an infinite amount of leisure time to enjoy them.  The people are remarkably fashionable and the women are known for their beauty. In my aging travel clothes, I frequently felt like a vagrant at a black-tie affair. But no matter, I spent the day walking through historic churches and meeting new friends at the hostel."

I was surprised he even asked me, as I do my best to prevent theft by looking disheveled. Nevertheless, I waved him off claiming I had no US currency.  He switched tactics using local currency and kept badgering me until I showed him my nearly empty wallet. He spied a 20 and a 10 Leva note and tried his scam on a smaller scale. At about $12\tit wasn't that much to loose. And besides, I was intrigued.\n\nSo I placed my two notes within my easy reach, far from him. He counted an assortment of five and one denomination notes and handed it over, asking me to count the pile. They added up and looked authentic so I started to think he had asked for an honest favor. But when I was done counting he asked me for the pile to confirm.\n\nHis slight of hand marveled the skill of any professional magician I'd ever seen. He counted with his hands in plain view, out in the open, and without any sleeves to hide cash in. When he returned the wad, abracadabra! I recounted and half the money had disappeared. \n\nI slapped my hand down on my cash and threw his back at him.

The whimsical architecture and patterns reminded me of an MC Escher drawing of real-life proportions.\n\nAs soon as I arrived, I regretted my decision to visit as a day trip from Sophia. I'd spent over six hours travelling to spend only 90 minutes here, while I could have spent the night in a monastery room with attached bath for only $10 a night. I pictured the quiet scene after dark, with most of the people gone and the chilly air cooled down even farther. Like the monks before me, I'd search for peace in a simple room with rough hewn floors and a simple bed. Maybe next time."

Most of this ungainly architecture can be blamed on Nicolae Ceausescu's outrageous spending and failed plans to shape the capital into a grand Communist showpiece.\n\nNowhere can his overspending be seen more clearly than the People's Palace, now the Palace of Parliament. This massive building is second in size only to the Pentagon, yet unlike most of the architecture in Bucharest, the Palace of Parliament is more attractive and ornamental. Even the entrance hall is spectacular with glassy stone floors laid out in patterns of five colors, enormous carved marble pillars, exquisite gold and crystal chandeliers, and a gilded wood ceiling.\n\nA huge marble stairway climbs up to the second floor, but sadly I never made it up there. Instead I fought with a tour operator who demanded that I ruin my expensive roll of 3200 high speed film by exposing it to their x-Ray machine. She was the first person in 13 months of travel to refuse my request for a hand search. I left the Palace fuming, having just paid money for a tour I couldn't take.\n\nSo much for freedom."

And though more recent times have brought stability and relative prosperity, petty crime, and street scams still curse parts of the country.\n\nThese facts buzzed through my head when I entered a Bucharest camera shop and struck up a conversation with the clerk, who warned me about the unsafe reputation of the neighborhood. But when I mentioned that I lived in Washington, D.C., he awoke to a whole new level of fear and told me that Washington was a hard place to live - that it is REALLY unsafe. I laughed and realized, as I have so many times this year, that he was probably right. So many would-be travelers fear crime abroad and choose not to leave home, when all along they would probably be safer here than in their own backyards."

From trolley bus to rail station to ticket vendor to departing train, yesterday's departure conspired to whisk me away to Sinaia without delay. \n\nSinaia was everything a skiing town should be in July, full of bustling cafes and the feeling of leisure, but surrounded in green forested hills and the festive colors of summer. I walked through the town's center to its cable car and spent the night up high at 1400 meters in a nearly empty cabana. My only companion in the quiet 8-bed dorm room was a gas furnace hissing away in the corner of my room all night and warming the cold mountain air. \n\nI hiked for a short while in the morning, near the 2000-meter terminus of the cable car. After soaking in the impressive 360-degree view of the surrounding Transylvanian mountains, I headed back down to town to see the Pelis Castle. \n\nPelis Castle is relatively modern, built between 1875-1914 as the summer residence of King Carol. But what impressed me most wasn't the castle's history, but its luxuriously rich decoration and architecture. I could see none other than a king walking over those plush red carpets, around the dark wooden walls carved with detailed ornamentation, and under the stained glass ceiling in the center of the room. (The ceiling actually slides open, aided by electric motors installed all the way back in 1883.) \n\nWood murals hung on the walls next to woven tapestries. The armory brimmed with antique guns, swords, and suits of armor. A beautiful wooden ornamental spiral staircase wound its way up to nowhere. Teak furniture and brilliant stained glass windows colored one room red, while a nearby room featured a gilded Arabesque ceiling and decorations modeled from Spain's Moorish Alhambra.  \n\nI left the castle impressed and headed off to the train station, where I waited hours due to a broken down train. Off to my next destination!  "

My single room hid at the end of a long dark hallway, the dismal surroundings reminded me of Van Gogh's famous painting of his rented room in Arles. Any week-to-week pensioner or starving artist would feel at home here, with a creaky wooden bed, aged wardrobe, lone chair, small writing desk, and sink all crammed into a tiny area.\n\nLucky for me, Brasov's streets excited me far more than my old hotel room. I spent hours in the central square, surrounded by the muted red, green, and orange colors of the nearby shops and open-air restaurants. The piazza swelled with community in the evening and provided me with free entertainment, watching young lovers share ice cream, men drink beer in cafes, and old ladies chat. \n\nA small terrier and a large curly haired mutt ran through the piazza together, biting and snapping each other in play. They barked from time to time, but kept quiet for the most part. Then all at once, the small dog started a five-minute wild chase after the big one, running in between bystanders and circling around benches to catch up. The accompanied high-pitched yelping gathered the attention of the whole square and every head turned to watch the show. What was once a collection of small individual groups was now one large audience. \n\nThe two dogs flew through a leftover rain puddle and sent a plume of water up into the air, like a water-skier pulling through a tight turn. People comically dove out of the way to avoid being hit by the spray. The crowd erupted all at once in applause and laughter. Then as abruptly as it started, the show was over and the individual groups resumed where they had left off."

I took a stroll through the bright streets of the walled in old section, looked down at the 360-degree view from the top of the town's clock tower, and read outside on a bench surrounded in sweet summer air.\n\nBut this little picturesque town has a darker and more interesting side, which I found with the help from a Brit named Jonathan. \n\nAfter dinner, Jonathan and I drank a beer in the birthplace-turned-restaurant of Vlad Tepes, aka Vlad the Impaler, aka Dracula. Vlad was born here sometime in the early 15th century and earned his \"Impaler\" notoriety with his favorite torture method for Turks - driving stakes though their spines to assure long tortuous 48 hour deaths. His \"Dracula\" nickname merely means \"son of  Dracul\", after his father Vlad Dracul. \n\nThey say he is wasn't a real vampire, just the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula. But I wasn't so sure. Jonathan and I left Vlad's home to visit a thriving local disco, where we stayed out till almost 5 AM. We returned to our guesthouse only after the disco emptied. Just like vampires, everyone fled just minutes before sunrise. \n\nCoincidence? I think not!"

      "text": "Traveling frequently turns out to be an endless succession of meeting new people and entertaining new thoughts.\n\nThis morning a 10-year old gypsy girl approached me on the train platform and asked for a 500 Lei coin. She was a mess - dirt covered her clothes and her unwashed blond hair stuck heavily to her head. But her smile radiated hope and her eyes shined with the brightness of intelligence. Her inward appearance cut right through the filth of poverty and made me see nothing other than an extremely cute kid who could grow up to be successful if given the proper circumstances.\n\nBut as a gypsy, she will no doubt be treated like the rest of the people in her ethic group. As far as I've seen, that is about as well as African Americans were treated before the civil rights movement. The gypsies frequently are blamed for society's problems and resigned to the lower ranks of the socioeconomic ladder. On several occasions, I've been warned to stay away from them, because they will \"lie, steal, and double-cross you without hesitation.\"\n\nI peeled a 2000 Lei note from my wallet, four times what she was asking for, but still under ten cents. Her eyes bulged with amazement and her face lit up with emotion. Starting with an introduction in broken English, she then talked with me for the next ten minutes. I was looking in my bags for an orange to give to her when my train pulled up to the platform. As I ran down the track to find my compartment she ran along side me and then waved me off with a smile that could melt the most cynical person's heart.\n\nMinutes later I started a conversation with a Romanian on his way home from Libya, where he worked as a chemical engineer in a fertilizer plant. With eight weeks in Libya and three weeks at home, he spoke highly of his working conditions, but was nevertheless anxious to return home to his wife and children.\n\nHis English was excellent, allowing our conversation to proceed farther than the basic, \"Where are you from?\" line of questioning I've become so used to. \n\nBoth the man and his wife lost their jobs with Romania's foray into the free-market economy, when former state sponsored business that relied on cheap oil from the Soviet Union shut their doors. Our train rolled by the chemical factory he previously worked in - the huge complex now laying in ruins, a communist dinosaur.\n\nThough he considered himself lucky to have such a good job, he stressed that the transition to a free-market economy might not be the best thing for Romania. Crime and unemployment are up. Traditional values are disappearing. And while foreign goods are readily available, they are too expensive for a country whose average salary is just $100 month. \n\nNot that communism was best. The man hated how they experimented with mind control, but added that the communists never succeeded in crushing the freedom of the individual. No matter what they tried, true freedom always existed in the mind  - the communist games always remained external.\n\nIn many ways with mind control, capitalism succeeded where communism failed. My compartment mate reminisced about a time shortly before the communist fall, when an English friend forgot about Easter Sunday. Even with the communist state sponsored crushing of organized religion, no Romanian would possibly forget such an important Christian celebration. Capitalism crushed religion more ruthlessly by accident than communism did on purpose.\n\nAs my train passed though the rural towns of Romania to the cosmopolitan city of Budapest, the landscape whirred by like a chart of economic growth. From bucolic villages with red tiled roofs and fields of bright sunflowers, to advertisement ladened rail yards defaced with spray paint graffiti.\n\nI pondered the path these countries decided to follow. The free-market brings riches, and with it the troubles of a consumer driven culture. Advertisers fill the streets and airwaves with messages promoting needs the people never knew they had. They now desire things that they can't obtain, or if they can, their satiation lasts only until the next desire takes its place. \n\nIt seems the nature of happiness doesn't lie in accruing the most stuff, but in learning to see beyond your manufactured desires and by living simply.  Somewhere along my train route from rural Romania to westernized Budapest, there existed a happy medium between communism and capitalism, between simple and complex.  \n\nThe trick is finding the balance in your life."

But it seemed much larger to me, with so much to see and do that I spent half my days walking, metroing, and bussing from place to place.  Transportation issues rarely seemed a drag, but rather opportunities to see more of the city besides its high points.\n\nAfter spending the afternoon visiting Castle Hill's gardens, avenues, stately buildings, art galleries, and historic churches, I headed to the Fisherman's Bastion for an excellent view of the city across the Danube - admiring the river boats gliding between the solid historic buildings that line the waterfront. \n\nI found street performers every 20 feet in some areas of Castle Hill, but they were not your garden variety chainsaw jugglers. True to Budapest's love of the arts, they all played classical music. I passed two giggly young women playing a fast-paced classical duet on matching violins. Nearby the pair, a lone flutist blew a morose tune to himself.    \n\nIn the mid-day heat I ducked underground to Castle Hill's spooky Labyrinth, a cold damp collection of caves and cellars converted into a cross between an art experiment and a haunted house. Strange noises such as heartbeats, drumbeats, whimsical music, and supernatural sounds echoed from the cave walls, which were under-lit by weak bulbs strategically placed to make the hair stand up on the back of my neck. The exhibition started with reproductions from the Lascaux cave paintings in France. It then got progressively unreal, eventually highlighting archeological \"finds\" from Homo Consumus - an exhibit poking fun of modern humans by looking at us through the eyes of people 40 million years in the future. \n\nWatching the visitors react to their unreal surroundings provided the most fun, especially when I inadvertently walked behind a young couple with my squeaky sandals and made them jump with fright. I laughed and said hello when I bumbled by, but they didn't shake off their look of fear. I didn't know I was that scary.\n"

But after I took their advice and went, I found that every other tourist in Hungary had the same idea. The narrow winding streets walled me in with crushing Japanese and American name-tag wearing tour groups playing follow the leader with an umbrella waving fast talker, and the atmosphere preserved scores of shops selling t-shirts, crafts, pottery, and knickknacks. \n\nBut I'm not being entirely fair, as the town did have a certain bit of charm. The view on Castle Hill floated me above a sea of red tile roofs and church spires. The haunting chants of a priest from the orthodox Belgrade Cathedral echoed in my consciousness all day. But of all things I saw in Szentendre today, the Microart Gallery won the award for coolness.\n\nAt just one room, the museum's small size was fitting for the type of art that they exhibited. You don't come here to see wall-stretching Guernica-sized paintings, but rather to peer through microscopes at bizarre works of art that could, and frequently did, fit on the head of a pin.\n\nThe first one I spotted featured a human hair cut lengthwise and used as a canvas, on which the word \"peace\" was inscribed in five languages. I might add that the handwriting on the hair looked far better than mine on a regular sheet of paper.  \n\nIn another work, the artist placed four camels, a palm tree, and a pyramid in the eye of a needle. (I guess he proved in his play on words that a rich man could enter the kingdom of God.)\n\nSixteen perfectly formed chess pieces rested on a chessboard and modeled the real life match between two masters. The board was actually sitting on the head of a pin.\n\nThe artist drilled one human hair lengthwise, forming a tube in which he inserted a miniature rose.\n\nIn my rounds of the exhibit, the miniature gold padlock and key impressed me the most. The work was perched on the end of a human hair, which when viewed in the microscope looked the size of a large dinner plate. Not to be outdone, the artist included  copies of the five moving parts inside to show you the finer details and to prove that it was indeed a working lock."

What better place to go than the Szechenyi Medicinal Baths for a little dip in the city's famous thermal pools?\n\nA short walk later, a cashier handed me a token and I entered through a turnstile. A gruff staffer in white pointed the way toward the men's locker room. I changed, an assistant secured my locker with a key, and I entered the maze of rooms.\n\nThe first room in the spa gave me an instant feel of what an ancient Roman bath looked like, with columns holding archways, carved marble ornamentation, and three pools of thermal hot water inviting me for a swim. I try two of them, one which was warmer than the other at a nice 100 degrees (38 C).  The jet behind my back did a great job of knocking the accrued pains of travel from my sore back, but my curiosity grew after 15 minutes and I left the pool to have a look around.\n\nThe center of the large facility opened into an outside courtyard, surrounded by ochre walls and white archways. A semi-circular thermal pool sat adjacent to a square lap pool. Fountains sprayed bathers with hot water. A few pairs of half submerged men played chess on boards built into the poolside, while a much larger group watched on with unbreakable attention. Their deep tans suggested that they played here everyday. I wondered if their tans stopped at the water's level.\n\nI walked back inside, dipping in and out of pools of various temperatures. Each room held a new surprise. The sauna opened into two rooms separated by a door. After a few minutes in the cooler room getting used to the temperature, I walked into the inner room and got hit with a blast of heat, like I had just stuck my face into a hot oven . I braved the whoosh of hot air in my face and read the thermometer on the wall, which read a blazing 150 degrees (65 C). Sweat poured from my body like someone was holding a garden hose above my head. After I couldn't take anymore, I jumped back into the 100 degree pool - to cool off.\n\nI returned back to my hostel feeling great and ready to walk some more, which I did, photographing the magic of Budapest at night until 2 AM.\n"

Now, hard as it was to believe, I was at the end. The plane's tires hit the runway with a loud thud andà I was home.\n\nThoughts swirled in my head as fast as the butterflies swirled in my stomach. After a year of adventure, where every day offered new sights, tastes, ideas, and people, I wondered how easily I would adjust to everyday American life again. The life of work, rush hour traffic, shopping malls, and a self-absorbed culture awaited me. None of them sounded too appealing. But other things did appeal to meà varying my wardrobe so I had more to wear than a couple of ratty t-shirts and two pair of pants, seeing loved ones, eating without fear of sickness, and no longer living out of a backpack. I looked forward to sleeping in a bed with a familiar pillow, driving a car, and jogging in the evening. \n\nI feel different inside. The person returning is a different person from the one who left. More at peace and with a calmer spirit I return. More educated about history, religion, environment, and culture, I feel closer to humanity and more connected to the world.\n\nIn the last year I flew on over 20 flights and each time went through a similar routine upon landing - I got my passport stamped in immigration, waited patiently for my luggage in baggage claim, then cleared my bag through customs. This time the routine was the same but the situation was different. I knew the currency, understood the language spoken, and my father was waiting to take me home as I walked through the arrival gate.\n\nIt was the end of one adventure, sure not to be my last.\n"

I found the attention a bit unnerving since I don't speak a word of Japanese. I know the town gets very few foreign tourists but from the attention I was receiving I concluded the Asian tourists that do visit must be Japanese. My parents met in Japan, I have black hair, and I crave sushi often, but these are the extent of my Japanese ways. \n\nSanfranbolu is a town situated in northern Turkey near the Black Sea. Its old Ottoman wooden houses make it an Unesco World Heritage Site and the lure of fine architecture drew us off Turkey's main tourist trail for a visit. The houses sit on steep hills, looking down on the main square, a mosque, a two-domed bathhouse, and a 350 year-old caravanserai (a way-station for traveling caravans). \n\nOn our first full day in Sanfranbolu we spent the day walking through the streets observing the architecture, stopping often to look up. The houses are large 3-storey structures made of wood and plaster. The old plaster walls, overhanging bay windows, decorative iron handles on gates, and textured wooden doors made it a feast for the eyes. The roofs are made of rugged terra-cotta tiles, adding orange warmth to the already rich environment. \n\nMost of the places we have visited in Turkey are popular tourist destinations and the locals have picked up enough English to communicate effectively with visitors. But in Sanfranbolu we found few that spoke English and for the first time we relied heavily on our Turkish guidebook's language section and found ourselves gesturing to communicate. Ordering food, checking into a hotel, catching a bus, and buying souvenirs became more like a game of charades than a business transaction. When gestures failed, we would draw pictures. Sometimes the business owners would bring out their English-Turkish dictionaries and we would teach each other words. The interactions made us laugh and we met many wonderfully patient Turkish people as we struggled to communicate.\n"

Scores of yellow and blue flames burned in patches around rocks. Other tourists were already up there sitting quietly around the flames, observing the natural phenomenon. A resourceful man took advantage of the flames and tourists and set up a drink stall over to the side, tea pots perched on the flames.\n\nIt is said long ago sailors on the open sea used the flames as landmarks.

So I agreed to cut my trip short and fly home early. We agreed Tim would keep traveling until the end of the summer through Europe. \n\nUpon arriving in Istanbul my first errand was to purchase an airline ticket home. The travel agencies were closed on Sundays and so I couldn't inquire about buying a ticket until Monday morning. I hoped to buy a plane ticket for the last day of June, leaving a week to tour the city and mentally prepare for my return home and separation from Tim. \n\nEarly on Monday we walked into a travel agency in the tourist area of Istanbul. Big colorful signs in the window advertised cheap international flights. The agents tapped at their keyboards, studied the computer screen, and made some calls to the airlines. Good news: there was a seat available (the only one in the next two weeks). Bad news: the flight left that night! Tim and I stared at each other in horror. I had to buy this ticket to get home but wasn't emotionally prepared to leave so soon. I was filled with conflicting emotions: sadness in leaving Tim and the travel lifestyle, excitement to see family and friends, surprise at leaving so quickly, anticipation of what life in the US would be like after traveling for so long. Reluctantly I handed over my credit card and within minutes I had an airline ticket in hand. \n\nWe set out into the city with a purpose. I had less than 12 hours to sightsee, buy presents, and pack. First we visited the Grand Bazaar, an indoor market of overwhelming size and merchandise. The bazaar began in the 15th century and since then, has only grown. Now it covers many kilometers and feels like a giant maze. We wandered for a couple hours looking at spices, clothes, Turkish carpets, lace, and an amazing selection of souvenirs. With only a little room left in my backpack I could only buy a couple t-shirts and decorative pillows. \n\nWe strolled through the park in front of the St. Sophia as the light glowed in the early evening. Then we ate a wonderful Turkish dinner on a rooftop restaurant. From here we could see ships sailing in the harbor, effortlessly gliding along the water. Brilliant sparkles shone off the golden spires of the nearby Blue Mosque as they reflected the setting sun. As our last meal together on the trip it was incredibly romantic and poignant. I kept taking deep breaths and looking around as I realized tomorrow I would be home and these were my final moments of this fabulous adventure.\n"

The endless rows of corn created a strange visual trick,  seeming to wave me on to my next destination as if they knew it was my time to leave.\n\nWhen night arrived I slept well, but awoke to find that yesterday's lush landscape had been replaced by the arid scrub land of coastal Croatia - a climate filled with stunted pine trees, rocky soil, farmhouses, olive trees, grape vines, and hard scratchy desert vegetation as found on the Greek islands. \n\nI stepped off the train in Split and was approached by a middle-aged woman with a lazy eye and leathery tanned skin who offered me a great deal on a \"private room\" - the area's choice budget accommodation. The owner of the room was a laughing old man with a beer gut and a knack for talking to me in Croatian despite the fact that I clearly didn't understand what he was saying. I unpacked my bags and after a well-deserved shower, walked around town exploring all day.\n\nOut by the waterfront, an old Roman facade impressively lined the street and overlooked cafes, palm trees, and manicured grass. Little boutiques and restaurants filled the labyrinthine alleys of the old city, catering to the many tourists who holiday here in the summer. \n\nThe area attracts an international crowd, I learned quickly, overhearing conversations between Hungarians, Bosnians, Germans, Austrians, Slovenians, and Croatians simultaneously.\n\nI walked leisurely though town and then stopped at an umbrella-covered table for a coffee and some peaceful time to write. As evening came, the streets swelled with people eating ice cream to the sound of hundreds of sparrows flitting above the city."

      "text": "Dubrovnik distinguished itself on my visit for two reasons, the first being the spectacular two kilometer walk around the old town along its protective  walls. The view from 25 meters high couldn't be better, with blue Adriatic water on one side and a skyline full of red tiled roofs, chimneys, and church spires on the other.\n\nThe second reason was Dubrovnik's availability of nude beaches. I decided soon after I read of Croatia's famed nude beaches that I'd have to go to one - visiting, of course, in the spirit of taking another new experience home from my trip.\n\nPlus, I admit, I thought it would be fun to write about.\n\nSo I started with the best of intentions, but spent yesterday with a woman from my hostel who I didn't want to strip down in front of. But we did go to a beach adjacent to the nude one and I had a chance to see first hand what to expect out of a visit.\n\nA naked man stood proudly upright a few feet from us on the regular beach with body language that screamed, \"I'm free! Look at me!\" He walked along the rocky coast with his hands on his hips. I thought to myself, \"I guess that is where you put them when you don't have pockets.\"\n\nTwenty other men and women on the beach went about business as usual, just without clothes on. They called themselves naturalists and they looked natural, so natural in fact that I kept seeing a family of primates on the rocks instead of vacationing Europeans. Forget the use of tools, I thought, the use of clothing really distinguishes us from the apes.\n\nI walked to a different nude beach the following day in full anonymity, unhampered by the company of any people I didn't want to see me nude. I wondered along the way if I could go through with it. Getting naked seemed so natural, but yet, I seldom even walk through a gym locker room without a towel on. And hell, I'd hate to be caught in a Speedo.\n\nI spotted the beach from the cliff above and noted that everyone seemed to have the same \"Look at me!\" attitude exuding from their body language. Hand painted signs along the threshold of the gate warned visitors that they were about to enter a clothing prohibited area and featured icons of bathing suits with slashes through them. \n\nI didn't know if I had to take my clothes off as soon as I entered or if I could break in slowly once unpacked on the beach.  I envisioned \"swinging freely\" across a crowded beach full of people. My heart pounded nervously and, even though I knew in my head that nobody on the beach cared, I reached the door and chickened out, instead deciding to swim at the beach next door.\n\nMaybe I'll start out slowly. I wonder, can I buy a Speedo around here?"

It didn't take long to figure out this was a mistake. Zagreb turned out to be quite a charming place with a feel somewhere between big city and comfortable small town.\n\nThe walk north from the train station passed by green parks and museums, while the central old section filled my eyes with lively canary yellow and peach colored buildings outlined in white trim. Many pedestrian-only areas made the city feel livable, with a fresh vegetable market that puts any supermarket to shame and a bewildering array of cafe tables to be found. \n\nWish I could have stayed longer, but I left to meet a friend in Slovenia.\n"

He wore a homemade pixyish hat fashioned from the shed bark of a palm tree and everywhere he went, he left the Samoans in hysterics. I knew then he would be someone worth keeping up with. \n\nAt the time I met him, I confused his country Slovenia with Slovakia - a big mistake in hindsight, now that I have a firm grasp of central European geography, but it is a small and new enough country that I should probably spout of a few facts about it before continuing...\n\nSlovenia broke from Yugoslavia in 1991 with one of the strongest economies in eastern Europe. So although it shares borders with Croatia and Hungary to the southeast, it feels much more like its other developed neighbors to the northwest - Austria and Italy. And with a land area as small as Wales and a population of only two million, it is an easy country to tour when you are short on time (especially when your friend has a car!).\n\nWe started out in the homey capital city of Ljubljana (sounds like Lyublyana) on a bright Saturday morning, where it seemed everyone was out buying vegetables from a well-organized open market adjacent to the Ljubljana River and the colorful buildings of town.  I loved the feel of the city - so full of life and energy, yet with a quaint small-town feel. It is a place where residents actually wait for walk signals before crossing empty intersections and lock their bikes with skimpy chains that could be broken by a single look from a New York City bike thief. \n\nAfter a quick tour of the city, we screeched up to the castle above town in the blue Mazda convertible that Greg bought as a \"fun summer car.\" Under maximum G's and the sound of a revving engine I learned about his car-racing hobby and the racecar he used to own.\n\nBut once I trusted his driving skills, I enjoyed his fast tour of Slovenia. We jumped off the highway to the local roads and approached the Julian Alps on sporty fun-to-drive pavement full of curves and hills. With the top down, the alpine air felt so clean and crisp, while the view of blue sky and cottony clouds hovering over mountain ranges looked spectacular. Greg spouted out Slovenia's old tourism motto, \"Welcome to the Sunny Side of the Alps.\"\n\nWe stopped first in Bled, a resort-ish town planted alongside a beautiful green-blue lake. The surrounding mountains added to its charm - covered in droopy pine trees and hosting Bled Castle from high above on a cliff across the water.\n\nIsland Church sat on a small piece of land in the center of the lake. When Greg described Slovenia's newlywed tradition of carrying brides up the 100+ stairs of its bell tower, I saw a boat full of well-dressed people singing and rowing out to visit. The bell rang later for good luck, also signaling, no doubt, that a sweaty groom was close to an early heart attack.\n\nWe left Bled via steep alpine roads and paused for a short scramble up to the head of the Izvir Soco River, where frigid blue water pours straight from a crack in the mountain. And after a peasant-style lunch in an old farmhouse immortalized by a series of children's movies,  we moved out of the mountains and entered a completely different geographical area - the Brda Valley wine region.\n\nOne could mistake the Brda Valley's  Mediterranean climate, rolling hills, vineyards, and red tile stone homes for Italy's Tuscany region. Indeed, northern Italy is so close you can see the border off in the distance. We climbed up to the top of a tall observation tower and had a 360-degree look around.\n\nBack on the tour, we stopped briefly at the small historic village of Stanjel, which hung somewhere between a quaint small town and ruins. The landscape changed to grassy rolling hills with leafy deciduous trees and we stopped again to catch the tail end of a casual get together in a small village - where the smoke from barbecued pork chops made me almost give up years of being vegetarian.\n\nBut we had to continue on, and headed to yet another region of Slovenia, the Adriatic coast shared with eastern Italy and Croatia. We stopped in the holiday town of Portoroz and on this Saturday, in the middle of summer, the streets were rocking with reveling partiers that made me feel like I was the only sober one in town. We found Greg's friends and spent the night in a local vacation home.\n\nIt isn't often that I get to see fun cities, historic villages, alpine mountains, Mediterranean vineyards, and coastal areas all in one day. But that is what makes Slovenia special - so much packed into one little place."

      "text": "The <i>Castle Story</i> as it came to be known should begin with the \"Once Upon a Time\" start of fairy tales, as it involves all of the classic ingredients of a good story - love, castles, and a princess (of sorts).\n\nThe prince, my Slovenian friend Greg, related the story to me on the side of a winding country road within view of a real castle, an enormous stone building nestled among tress on the side of a mountain. The story goes a little like this...\n\nPrince Greg worked hard and provided well for the princess Simona as a successful businessman. But all was not well in the kingdom, as the princess felt neglected by the prince who spent far to many hours at work focusing on his career.\n\nDiscussions came and went, yet prince Greg still focused on work over Simona. So the princess left in despair and forced the prince to re-evaluate his priorities more seriously. \n\nHe soon understood that his life was unbalanced. But how could the prince make amends?\n\nHe started by enlisting the help of his friends and in just five short days, carried out his plan to win the princess back.\n\n<img src=\"/photos/sv_gregs_castle.jpg\" alt=\"Greg's Castle\" width=\"320\" height=\"166\" align=\"right\">First, he needed a castle for his kingdom, which after much negotiation he rented from a private owner. Then he crafted an excuse to lure the princess away from the city and to his new palatial home.\n\nAs it turns out, Simona occasionally worked as an event hostess to supplement her income while attending university. So Greg had the general manager of a marketing agency call her with the job of hosting a five year anniversary party of a fictitious company. A company secretary followed up with details and a project manager delivered the princess to the castle on the appointed day, requesting her to report upstairs to start setting up.\n\nA rose greeted the princess on the stairs with a note quoting the first line of a poem by the famous Slovenian poet <a href='http://www.uvi.si/eng/new/background-information/preseren/'>France Preseren</a>. A few stairs later, another rose appeared with the next line of the poem. Farther up, two more notes completed the stanza, which loosely translated reads:\n\n<blockquote>I hoped and waited for a long time,\nthen said good-bye to hope and fear.\nMy heart is empty, there is no luck.\nI want my hope and fear back.</blockquote>\nPetals from 36 roses lay sprinkled around the floor at the top of the stairs around a single large rose with a note explaining to the princess the real reason she had been summoned to the castle. The note explained that their relationship had been good and could be good again, if only Simona would look over the wall and make a wish. If she did so, whatever she believed at that moment would come true.\n\nBut sadly the princess didn't make her wish, she looked instead for the prince who watched her from above. They talked at length, but Simona left the castle and Prince Greg unconvinced - she decided to stay away from the kingdom.\n\nThought this story should have a happy ending? Me too, and if I wasn't travelling I'd add a \"Vote for Greg\" button so that we could all have a say. But the tale may not be over yet and if you have any good ideas for Greg to help him reunite with his princess, you can send him a <a href='mailto:gregben@hotmail.com'>note</a>!<br>\n<hr>\nIt has been six months since I wrote this story and I am now home, more or less settled and planning new adventures. But all this time the prince has been working hard for his princess. And who should write me this morning but the prince himself, bearing good news from Slovenia. The princess is back in the kingdom and read this web entry for the first time just the other day. \n\nSimona herself finished the story with its only appropriate ending. She added, \"and they lived happily to the end of their days.\"  \n- Jan 29, 2002\n"

      "text": "Venice needs little introduction, as all its stereotypes breath in reality - stripe-shirted oarsmen, bow shaped gondolas, graceful canals, historic buildings, romantic accordion music, and labyrinthine streets. But I arrived in summer during tourism's peak season and spent my first day head spun by the incredibly huge crowds. The popular Paizza di San Marco, for example, lures tourists with its beautiful basilica covered in mosaics and marble, but it fills to capacity like Washington DC's mall on the 4th of July or New York's Times Square during New Years Eve. Every day, all day long.\n\nIt isn't hard to escape the fray, but doing so requires loads of energy and the ability to walk, walk, and walk some more - you just have to head straight from the touristic areas and not consult a map until its time to go home.\n\nThe streets seem to be planned by a Venetian throwing spaghetti onto a cartographer's table - leaving a jumbled maze with unexpected turns and large avenues that suddenly compress down into alleys hardly wide enough for two people to walk side by side. The layout reminded me of a small village Michelle and I visited on a Greek island, where residents designed their streets with a similar chaotic layout to purposefully confuse invaders. But Venice is at least 200 times larger and more complex. Even so, I always ran into a familiar road, eventually getting home safely. And by banging around the city in this unplanned manner, I found the quiet parts of the city where only dawdling old women broke the peace of their neighborhoods.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about Venice was its historic decrepitude. The residents can sweep the streets until their brooms fall apart, but nothing will sweep away the years of grunge that cover the sidewalks. Large patches of plaster will continue to fall from walls like bark from old trees and layers of weathered brick will continue to be exposed. Watermarks will stain the walls and continue to blemish the quiet shades of red, yellow, and brown. And while Venice may one day pass laws restricting its residents from hanging laundry over canals, the paint from nearby window shutters will continue to peel and the canal will still be green. \n\nThe city was so alive with texture that I felt it with my eyes. \n"

One row of homes might look like this:\n\nAn aquamarine home next to one painted hot red, both with white window frames and green shutters. They sit adjacent to a bright yellow house with red shutters and others painted lavender, baby blue, plum, maroon, peach, purple, and an ugly mint color that saw its heyday in the 1950's.\n\nGroups of flowers with purple petals and green leaves sprout from the window box of a purple home with green shutters. Such color coordination! \n\nEven the fragrant hanging laundry about the streets might match the home - like blue and white cloud print sheets suspended from the second floor of a baby blue house. Or in the opposite, yellow pants hanging next to dark blue paint. \n \n\n"

      "text": "I could whine about my everlasting train ride, but truth be told it wasn't as bad for me as for the others involved. On the night I left Venice and headed north to Vienna, an Italian train hit a maintenance vehicle and injured 40 people. The accident forced my train to detour far west from its planned route and by the time we were due to arrive, we were probably about as far away from Vienna as when we started. Luckily, I could nap well in my sleeper or was content to just watch the mountains roll by out the train window.\n\nBut after 20 hours, twice the time our trip was scheduled to take, I was scratching just as hard at the couchettes to get out as all the other passengers. Our arrival in Vienna ended with a jailbreak-like exodus from the train.\n\nA much needed shower reset my mood back to normal and I went downtown to have a look around with a few new friends. Along the way we asked a well organized tourist information center where we could buy groceries. The otherwise helpful woman laughed. \"You are in Austria. Everything closes for the weekend after 5 PM on Saturday.\"\n\nIt was a sad truth, nowhere more evident than on Sunday in a busy pedestrian plaza full of people out window-shopping - in the true sense of the phrase, because not a single store except for a few cafes or odd magazine vendors were open. Not that buying material things gives life to a city, but it tended to suck life from the otherwise sleepy atmosphere.\n\nVienna... a wealthy city with exceptionally beautiful buildings. Cleaner than an operating room and more orderly an accountant's sock drawer. But still singing, \"If I only had a heart.\"\n\nIn all fairness, we spent the next two nights in a thriving historic district watching outdoor movies shown against the neo-gothic Rathaus (City Hall) building and eating from upscale food stalls that served a wide variety of decent international food - from Chinese to traditional sausage. Our little group spilled out from the occupied cafe tables and drank with small groups in the surrounding gardens. In what I considered the most impressive part of the two nights, the event staff served their great selection of beer from hearty half liter glasses - not plastic cups. That seemed to make all the difference! \n\nNevertheless, I felt a lack of depth and life to Vienna. It is hard to describe, but a crowded street in Vienna still feels somehow empty. I'm not sure what the secret is, but after visiting several European cities full of joie de vivre, Vienna gave me the cold shoulder."

I rolled on to Bratislava along the same hazy rolling hills, but everything else pass the border appeared more rustic and less shiny. A crop of ugly high rise buildings lifted up out of surrounding corn fields and fleets of state of the art 1950s wheat threshers worked the fields. Nearby, an old Czech Skoda car rusted by the side of the tracks. My train entered the main rail station through a tunnel on the opposite track, since a graffiti covered locomotive that probably hadn't moved since Glasnost blocked our side. \n\nI began to question my plan to stay a few days when I passed rows of block apartments so ugly that even the occasional well intentioned-flower boxes seemed to call attention to how bad the surrounding buildings looked rather than to beautify them.\n\nBut after all of this, my opinion of Bratislava turned around after just five minutes in the pedestrian area of its historic center.\n\nIt was Tuesday after work and a bewildering selection of outdoor cafes served espressos and big half liters of beer to what looked like the whole city out having fun. Ah! A city that knows how to live! Cafe tables ran down the length of each street, which was surrounded in restored pre-Communist buildings that were not exactly colorful, but pleasantly warm. A few eight sided onion domes lent a distinctive flair to the skyline.\n\nI chose a restaurant for dinner by peeking at what was being served, then ordered a salmon dish for myself. Though it was the most expensive thing on the menu, my entree plus a tasty local beer didn't even set me back $5. \n\nStrangely enough, my salmon was served with a baseball-sized dollop of butter so large I thought it must have been a side dish. I was so sure, in fact, that I heaped a large spoonful in my mouth to see what it was. I retched with the urge to spit out immediately, but noticed a man nearby who saw the whole thing and seemed to await my reaction. Not wanting to look more foolish than I already felt, I swallowed the butter and pretended as though I meant to do that.\n\nAt least I could wash the taste out of my mouth with my choice of ice cream in the lively square after dinner.\n"

Transport me back to the American suburbs! \n\nThere is so much competition for the tourist dollar that hawkers stand around the old town square holding signs advertising all sorts of stuff... from the Museum of Medieval Torture Instruments, to the Spiders and Scorpions Museum, plus a bagel/internet joint, and performances of Jesus Christ Superstar or Cats. A four member fife and drum corps even passed me in full period dress advertising performances of Don Giovanni. \n\nOther hawkers chased me across the cobblestone streets handing out flyers with such enthusiasm that if I had no arms, they would be stuffing them in my mouth.\n\nOf course, there is a reason for Prague's popularity. It is a beautiful and inexpensive city with much to offer, from castles and colorful architecture to the nighttime cityscape reflecting off the Ultara river. And as an added bonus, excellent Czech beer. The most famous of which is the real Budweiser, Budvar, which unlike the American version is full bodied and excellent.  (It is too bad American Budweiser prohibits this from being sold in the US.)\n\nI enjoyed my time in the city and met lots of new friends, but if you are planing a trip here, do yourself a favor and come in the spring or fall.

He even drove me to Berlin for the weekend for a tour. We dined in nice restaurants, drank in beer gardens, relaxed with his friends and girlfriend Maret, went to a late night student disco, and barbecued on his back porch. I learned more about Germany through my talks with him than I ever could have hoped to on my own.\n\nSebastian grew up in the former East Germany with two dreams - the first to cross into West Berlin through the Brandenberg Gate and the second to visit his relatives in Namibia. Since the fall of Communism and Reunification, he has accomplished both and now enjoys a lifestyle that he thought would never be possible 10 years ago.  \n\nIt is a new world in East Germany, a place where construction cranes hang above every skyline. Sebastian pointed to shopping malls near the center of Dresden, \"That one is five years old, this one is two years old, these are three years old.\" You can easily see the three eras of Dresden architecture - historic pre-war monuments, Communist style apartments, and buildings from the last ten years.\n\nNot every German feels as excited as Sebastian about the changes in their country. Thousands lost their jobs in the transition, including Sebastian's father and Maret's mother. And while Sebastian's father now works for himself producing <a href='http://www.seiffen.com/'>Christmas crafts</a> in his home in Seiffen*, Maret's mother has suffered with 10 years of unemployment. With Germany's 15% unemployment rate and the disappearance of lifetime guaranteed employment, it is easy for me to understand the success of current Communist politicians in Berlin. They run for office with slogans similar to, \"Are you better off now than you were ten years ago?\" The answer is just as clear for Sebastian as it is for Maret's mother - those who have found success in the last ten years verses those who have found heartache.\n\n\n<hr><font size='small'>* Seiffen is Sebastian's home town, a village of 3000 located near the Czech border in what used to be East Germany.

Post-war peace only truly came in the last decade. But memorials to the old times live on everywhere:\n<ul><li>The cold war's Checkpoint Charlie, a crossing point between east and west, once hosted a permanent face off between Russian and US tanks.

It now too serves as a monument to history.</li>\n\n<li>Parts of the old east was once dominated by ugly ten story apartment buildings and wide Communist-style avenues. The buildings are still there, but the  neighborhoods have sprouted with scores of new cafes and have become fashionable places to live.</li></ul>\nIt is increasingly hard to tell what used to be east from what used to be west, especially with all of the construction in the former border area. Ten years ago Potsdamer Platz was virtually empty, but now it is full of new glass and steel structures, plus at the time I counted, 35 construction cranes building more. This new construction is like a suture on a wound, healing the city that has been destroyed and split apart for so long."

      "text": "The scent of pot smoke in a public place normally sends me scanning my surroundings like a prairie dog searching for predators, standing upright and alert, wondering with curiosity who is breaking the law.  But it didn't take me long to loose that reaction in Amsterdam, as the smell wafts through every street and visitors roll joints in plain view of the police.\n\nThis afternoon is sunny and pleasant. I'm in an undistinguished coffee bar near the red light district, similar to the others found around the city. One menu offers drinks, another offers a variety of cannabis with different strengths and qualities, plus space cakes and other goodies. Most of the people around me are smoking joints like cigarettes, or in process of rolling a joint. But there is no stigma attached to this, for right next to me a German family is ordering drinks and laughing. I'm eavesdropping over two normal looking men in their late 50's as they talk about European history and the spread of Christianity. \n\nAnd they've smoked a couple of joints during the time I've been sitting here.  \n\nThe cafe looks like any other in Europe, with people enjoying an afternoon outside. Nobody looks particularly drug addled or stupid, and without the stigma, pot smoking seems normal.\n\nMany activities that would seem deviant at home take place in the open here. Yesterday I waited for a friend outside of the popular Sex Museum, which displays historical pornography, humorous exhibitions, and a few images in a specially labeled room that I probably shouldn't describe here, as I don't want the web site banned by schools, libraries, and upset parents. \n\nThe crowd that entered the museum held my interest as much as the museum itself, mostly because they seemed so.... normal. Just regular people, ranging from giggling teenagers to elderly grandparents, viewing each exhibit with almost the same regularity as patrons in the Van Gogh Museum.  Ever so often I'd remember where I was and laugh myself back to reality - like when I studied an exhibit of 25 dirty black and white photos from the 1930's  while a retired couple stood next to me doing the same.\n\nThe city is open to almost whatever you want to do, and whatever that is can be done in the open.\n\nMy hostel has a beer machine.\n\nHerbal stores sell psychedelic mushrooms in carefully measured packages, with suggested dosages and detailed descriptions of what each variety does and how long they last. (Four to five hours, excited buzz similar to...)\n\nThe Erotic Supermarket doesn't hide behind boarded windows, but displays its sex toys, latex clothing, and Tarzan outfits behind  nicely decorated windows. \n\nTour guides now whisk retirees through the surprisingly upscale red light district, which now draws more tourists for free gawking than for paid sex. I can't imagine anything like this outside of Amsterdam - rows of women behind glass doors motioning to you to come forth, but displayed like sandwiches in the Febo fast food vending machine restaurant.  I particularly enjoyed watching the group of sheepish 40-60 year old couples waiting in line  for a live sex show.  What is this world coming to?\n\nThe only time I've seen the police do anything was last night at 3 AM  in a public square with people smoking joints all around me. I was told off by a police woman for drinking a beer in public - something that is 100% legal in most of Europe.  \n\nBut I guess that is why I am in Amsterdam - to stretch my freedom in ways that I could never do at home, even if that means getting yelled at for the smallest offense."

In short, the perfect opposite of the city I just arrived from, the antitheses of Amsterdam.\n\nBruges felt so clean and straight - a hyper-quaint medieval village with cute pointed spires, clock towers, narrow buildings, and graceful waterways. \n\nIn so many ways I loved Amsterdam for being dirty. But entering Bruges was like stepping out of a smokey bar into the fresh night air - I suddenly realized how polluted my lungs were and enjoyed a deep cleansing breath."

      "text": "I hate to use such a silly expression, but there is no other way to describe the Thalys high speed train...\n\nIt hauls ass. \n\nBut what would you expect out of a train that makes the Brussels to Paris trip in a short 1:20 and whose operational speed reaches 300 kph (188 mph)? \n\nI catch myself using the word \"flight\" instead of \"ride\", but \"flight\" is more fitting than a word that holds you to the ground.\n\nThe Thalys' tracks banked like a racecourse and tilted me hard around corners - sometimes with the same jerky motion of a roller coaster. I crested hills fast enough to feel the same fall in my stomach that I would get from zipping over a small rise too fast in my car. I passed highway traffic so quickly that it appeared to be standing still.\n\nThe effect reminded me of the last few minutes before landing... bank right, bank left, quick rise, quick fall, then small jerky movements followed by periods of smooth flight. All the while, your destination seems so close that the expectation of arrival never leaves the back of your mind."

      "text": "I find myself increasingly bored by the realism of classical art.  What is to be gained by painting a scene perfectly when these days, a photo would do a better job?\n\nI like art that punches me in the gut, that makes me love, hate, feel joy, be afraid, or gives me a sense of wonder about the world I live in. I find that classical art falls down in this respect. Where is the emotion? Look an enormous battle scene and you won't see the anguish of real death on the painted faces, but the anguish of studio models holding their poses for 10 hours straight. \n\nSo with that said, the Museum of Modern Art in the Centre Georges Pompidou sent me straight to heaven. What a collection!  Klee, Kandinsky, Picasso, Caldor, Chagall, Corbusier, Dali, Miro, Ernst, Matisse, Warhol, Man Ray, Brassai, and so many other wonderful lesser-knowns.\n\nFinally, a collection with soul. \n\nI floated through the museum, breathing  inspiration and energy from the work around me. My mind was awash with creativity - ideas shooting at me from all directions while my hand struggled to keep notes. I felt at peace with the world and lost myself for the day, completely throwing away all the plans I'd made for the afternoon.\n\nThat is what real art is all about."

What a life.\n\nIt is Sunday, but the only Sunday suits that I see are the blue and white stripped shirts of San Sebastian's soccer team. Today's match between San Sebastian and Bilbao marked the start of the season, and as you can imagine, people started the party early. The streets below my pension were echoing with the sound of revelers by the time I woke up and by 2 PM, the street had grown into a miniature Mardi Gras - with loud music, random fireworks, bawdy singing, and trash covered pavement.\n\nBut this is Basque country, home of a strong separatist movement. Today on my narrow street alone, Basque separatists hung banners and a vendor sold separatist t-shirts from a nearby stall.\n\nThe people rally behind their Basque team as an icon of independence. So soccer is more than just a game. It is a chance to make a political statement.\n\nForty-five minutes before game time, the large drunk party organized into a political march and walked from the old section of San Sebastian to the stadium en masse. They chanted slogans, threw fireworks, and flew the red, green, and white colors of their nationalist flag.\n\nI followed the parade along with my friends and got caught up in the moment. With so much energy and excitement, it seemed just clean fun. But the movement's violent side is responsible for many deaths, including two people here in San Sebastian just a few days ago. So maybe it wasn't the smartest thing to do. But what could be safer than hanging out with the terrorists themselves - at least I knew I was safe from bombs in their company."

Yes, you heard me right. I'm back home in Washington, D.C., facing another full time job in the nine-to-five world. But I have so much more to share about my trip - five weeks of stories (resurrected from the unfortunate accident with my Palm handheld), reflections of being home, help for people interested in taking similar journeys, and a new photo database with hundreds of photos fresh from the photolab. (I'm weeding these from over 3,500 - you should see the mess!)\n"
